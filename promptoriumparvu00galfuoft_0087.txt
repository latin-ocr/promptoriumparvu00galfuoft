declared at the commencement :——“ Liber iste vocatur femina quia sicut
femina docet infantem loqui maternam sic docet iste liber juvenes retho-
1100 loqui gallicum.'’ The concluding chapter, “ De moribus infantis,''
gives admonitions for discrcet behaviour in the various relations of social
life, citing the savorite moral treatise by Magnus Cato, the Proverbs of
solomon, and the like, and ending as follows :—

“ ἹῙ Ore pricz dieu issint puissetez finer,
Qe a sonn joye purrcz vener.
Now prayeth God so 3e may end,
That to hys joye 5e may konie, so be hyt. Amen.’'

Then follows a “ kalendcr '⁷ or alpliabetical table of words in three
columns, “linia scripcionis,’' the word written according to the orthography
of the peri0d3 ‘⁴ Regula locucionis,⁷' the proper pronunciation3 “Regula
const1·uccionis,” the English rendering of the word. For instance, “ Chien
secundum pikardiam, Chaan secundum parisium,'’ as written under the
first head, is to be pronounced “ cheen vel chann, an hounde ;” and
“ Chiet secundum pikardiani, Chiat secundum parisium,” has the pronun-
ciation “ cheet vel chaat, an kat.'’ This curious table ends with the aspi-
ration “ Qui scripsit cannen sit benedictus. Ame11.—-Explicit Femina
nova.”a

Ι learn, with great regret, from the librarian, Mr. Aldis WVright, that this
precious volume, which was restored by me in Feb. 1844, is no longer to
be found amongst the MSS· at Trinity College. It is fortunate that some

portions should have been preserved by Hickes, although insufficient to
make amends to the philologist for so untoward a loss.b

ὃ The volume was thus entered in the catalogue,—“B. 14, 39; Liber de Ordine
Creaturarum3 B. 14, 403 the Life of St. Margaret in very old English verse; Liber
rhetoricus dictus Femina, et Miscell. alia.'' Its value was well known through notices and
sao-similes given by Hickes, Ling. Septentr. Thes. vol. i. pp. 144, 154. The Life of St.
Margaret is there printed entire, pp. 224, 231, and described as “ Dialecti Normanno-
Saxonicae omnium longe nobilissimum specimen ;” thirteen distiches are also given from
“ Femina.'' Some notice of the MS. is given by Sir Henry Ellis, Orig. Letters, third
series, vol. ii. p. 209.

ὓ At the close of the “Femina'' is a treatise of the same kind but of later date,
giving phrases, idioms, and dialogues suited for the requirements of a traveller3 one of
these is between a person fresh from the wars os Henry V. and another who asks the
