l“To cone, to cunne, scires* CATH. ANG. “C‘qqnoscere, scientiam habere, to
conne.'’ ORTUS. To eonne is used in this sense by Chaueer, and iu the Wieliffite ver-
sion, 1 Cor. ii. 2, is rendered thus, “ Ι deeme not me to kunne ony thing? Caxton
remarks in the Boke for Travessem, ‘⁶ It is a good thffng to eonne a good craft,
s‹·‹12:02·7·.'' So likewise 111 1110 Legenda Aurea, f. 92, b. “O who sholde oonne shewe
hereupon the seeretes of thyne herte ! '' Palsgrave gives ‘⁴ to konne, learne or knowe,
παι-οἷν. Ι can konne more by herte 111 a day, than he can in a weheg '' and ‘⁶ to conne
thanke, or can one good thanke, scavoz'r bon 97⁴5st “Thou shalt kun me thanke.’'
HORM. See Jamieson. Ang. Sax. connati, scire.

² “A cmmynge, scientia, facultas.” CATH. ANG. ‘⁶ Connynge is 01⁰ that thou haste
lerned the memory or mynde, and reteyneth that thou sholdest forgete.’' Legenda
Aurea, f. 53. Aug. Sax. cunning, experientia.

³ This word is used by Lydgate in the Coneords of Company, Minor Poenis, p. 174,

“ With theru that ferett robbe eonyngerys.”

Among the Privy Purse expenses of Heni-y VII. is a payment in 1493, “ for making of
the Conyngerthe pale.’' Horman observes that “warens and conygers and parkis
palydde occupie 11106116 grounde nat inhabitatum, leporarioe sive lagsotrophz'a.'' Elyot
gives “ Vivarium, a counnyngar, a parke3’' and Thomasx in his Italian Grammar,
1548, uses the word to denote a pleasanee, or inclosed garden, “ Horti (li Venere. the
womans secrete oonnyngersst' ‘⁴ Cony garthe, (sare-nae. Cony hole or clapar, tais-
ἤϊε-νε, terrz'er, ‹·lappz'er.'' PALSG. In the Pastori Letters‚ iv. 426, the term ‘⁶ konyne
elosse '¹ occurs in the same sense. In almost every county in England, near to ancient
dwelling-places, the name Coneygare, Conigree‚ or Coneygarth occurs, and various eon-
jectures have been made respecting its derivation, which, however, is suffieiently obvious.
See Mr. Hartshorne’s observations on names of places, Salopia Antiqua, p. 258.

⁴ Coinoun, or konioun‚ occurs in Kyng Alisaunder, and is explained by Weber as
signifying eoward, or sooundrel, from the Frenoh coion, which has that meaning.

“ Alisaundre! thou coinoun wode.'’ line 1718.
“Pes ξ quoth Candace, thou konioun ἔ ” line 7748.

Here. however, the word seems merely to signify a dwarf. See hereafter DWEROWE.

⁵ The first record of a mint at Lynn, where the Promptorium was eompiled, occurs
in 9th John, 1208, but there was possibly one in earlier times, and the name occurs on
the coins of Edgar. Parkins supposes that it fell into disuse about 1344, 18 Edwt 111.;
and he states that the Bishop of Norwieh had also a mint there, but the fact is ques-
tionable. See Blomefield's Hist. Norl'. iv. p. 532, and Ruding's Annals of the Coinage

ii. 198.
