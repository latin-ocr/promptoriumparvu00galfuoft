”nnz'us ejusdem etatis, euen olde.'' ORTUS. Horman says, “ lyke as I se my son do for his
frende and euen3elde (equalis) and help hym in his maters, so it is right that we olde
nien shuld help and do eche for oder.‘' Ang. Sax. efen-eald, coemes.

¹ The term evesynge, from the Ang. Sax. evesung, tonsura, evese‚ mmyo, occurs in
the gloss on G. de Bibelesworth; MS. at Middle Hill.

‘⁶ Ec cenerounclel (sparewe net) ἁ la cenerounde (at be euesinge)
Prent le musskoun et le aronnde (swalewe).”

“ Seuerunder ὰ Za severuncle (a serundel at be eueses).'' Arund. MS. 220, f. 301, b.
It would seem hence that it was usual to take small birds, as the vnuskeron. or sparrow‚
and the swallow, by means of a net adjusted to the house eaves ; they probably sen-ed,
as they do still in Italy and Southern Europe, as articles of food. In Piers Ploughman's
Vision are mentioned “ Isykles in evesynges;'‘ and in the Creed “Orcheyarde and
erbers evesed wel elene ;'' in which instance the word seems to be used precisely in the
sense of the Aug-saxon verb efesian, tondere, unless it may signify that the erber, or
garden of herbs, was neatly hedged in. The Medulla renders “ intonsus, vnevesed.
Antipoplmra‚ an evesynge.’' In the North of England the eaves are called easings.
‘⁶ Sea-emme, the eane, eauing, or easing of a house.'' co'rGR.

² The word chefe, signifying chance or fortune, has occurred already, but in the MS.
is written, as it would seem erroneously‚ CHEP. It appears to be taken from the French
chef, chief, which, according to Roquefort, implies not only the head, or the commence-
ment of a thing, but the end, issue, or extremity. Chaucer, in the Merchant’s second
Tale, speaks of “the boncheff and the myseheff3’' and in the account of William
Thorpe's examination by Abp. Arundel in 1407, published by Foxe from a contemporary
authority, it is related that he said, ‘⁴ if I consented to you to doo heere after your will
for bonchefe or mischefe that may befall me in this life, Ι deme in my conscience that
I were worthy lierefore to be cursed of God.”
