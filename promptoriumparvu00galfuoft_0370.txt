¹ Diem, according to the Catholicon, signif-les a day'sjourney ε the term occurs in this
sense in Braeton and Fleta, where it is said that “ omnis rationabile dieta constat est: τυ.
1ηίίι”(ιν·ἰῖ)1ι.ς.” Chaueer uses the word in this sense= Knight's T. 2540 ; Chaucer’s Dream,
19453 and also in that of a day's work, Rom. of Rose, 579. Journey had also the
signification of a day’s conflict, in like manner as the expression “the day '' is used at
present. Thus in the Paston Letters it is said of the Battle ot' St. Allian’s, 1455, that
“alle the Lordes that dyed at the jorney arn beryed at Seynt Albanes; ” and the en-
gagement is termed ‘⁶ the male journey '⁹ of St. Alban’s‚ meaning, apparently, the disas-
trous battle. Vol. i. 108, UO. See Jamieson, v. Jorneye. In Norfolk‚ Journey implies
the time a man is at plough. about six hours ; if he works niue, two Journeys are taken.

‘² In the Catholicon susurro is rendered murmurator, and susurrium, marmur, latens
locutio. Both the English and Latin words are here evidently onomatopeias, and in like
manner the sound produced by different birds is termed jurring‚ or jarring. In the
Libervocatus Femina, MS. Trin. Coll. Cant„ amongst the noises of animals, it is said
that ¹‘ Colure «feritet, et cols 0111111111, coluere iurrut, and col< syngeb.'' To jurre signifies
also to strike harshly against any thing, in which sense it is uad by Holland, Pliny,
B. ix. 303 Livy, p. 963. Cotgrave gives “L'‹)‹·querv to butte 01· jurre. Hem-ter, to
knock, push, jur, joult‚ or hit violently against.'’ Jamieson gives jurr as signifying the
noise of water falling among loose stones.

³ Jusselle was a compound of egge and grated bread, with saffron and sage, boiled in
broth. The name seems to have been taken from the ancient dish called ‘fuscellum by
Apicius. See directions for making “Jusshelw in the Forme of Curyff pp. ⁴28, 973
Harl. MS. 5401, p. 198. The Libo· cure cocorum supplies, under the head de I’olaylis‚
the following metrieal recipe for ‘⁶ Iusselle.'' ²
