2 Previously to the XVIth cent. the ordinary mode of construeting houses in the
Eastern countieS, as likewise in other parts of England, was by forming a frame of wood,
or skeleton structure, the intervals or paneis being afterwards filled up with brickwork,
lath and plaster, or indurated earth, hythe process called in Norfolk dawbing. Such
construetions are usually termed timbered houses, or, in Slnopshire, Cheshire, and
neighbouring counties, where they are found highly ornamented, blaek and white
houses. Harrison, who wrote his description of England about A.D. 1579, being re-
sident in Esses, observes that “the ancient manours and houses of our gentlemen are
yet and for the most part of strong timber, in framing whereof our carpenters haue
been, and are, worthilie preferred before those of like scicnce among all other nations.
Howbeit, such as be latelie builded are comonlie either of bricke or hard stone, or
bothJ’ B. ii. e. 112, Holinshed‚ Chron. i. 188. It is from this period that a marked
change in the costly and ornamenta} character of domestic architectum in England is to
be dated; previously, with the exception of some parts where the abundant supply of
stone occasioned a more frequent use of such solid materials‚ houses were ordinarily of
framed work. Pabgrave says, ‘⁶ My house is framed all redye (ι’Ῐιανρεηίὲ), it wanteth
but setting up.'' Among the disbursements for building Little Saxham Hall, A.D.
1507, by Thomas Lucas, Solicitor General to Heinry VII. occur payments “to the joy-
nours for franiyng of 6 obumbres, ‘25s. For framyng of my great parlour and great
chambre, los.'' Rokewode‘s Hist. Suff. 147. The statute 37 Hen. VIII. e. 6, 1545,
recites that certain novel outrages had of late been practised‚ such as “the secret
burnynge of frames of tyinber prepared and made, hythe owners therof, redy to be
sett up, and editicd for liouseS.” This misdemeanour was made felony.
