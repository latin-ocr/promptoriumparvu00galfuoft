appears that the jewelled work termcd Anylicum opus was, at the commencement of the
XIth cent. in high esteem even in Italy (Murat. Script. Ital. iv. 360 ε) and in the times
of Boniface VIII. about the year 1300, are mentioned ‘⁴ v. aurzfrzyz'a, quorum iij.
fiunt de opere Cyprensi nobilissimo, et unum. est de opere Anqlicano, et unum est ad
smaltos.'‘ Lib. Anniv. Basilice Vatic. ap. Joan. Rubeus. Among the gifts of Thos.
Langley‚ Bp. Durham, who died 1437, were a vestment of crimson velvet, “ casum, zj.
tuniculis, et capd principali habente orfrays consimiles auri de Cyprys,” and other
vestments of baudkyn, with ⁴⁴ orfrays de baudekyn rubim, conteoel’ cum cervis et avibus
miride prrys,'' διο. Wills and Inv. Surtees Soc. i. 88. The orfrays seem to have
been frequently separate, so as to be used at pleasure with the vestment of colour
suitable to the day. Inventories and wills afford innumerable evidences of the extra-
ordinary richness of these deeorations, and curious information as to the perfection to
which the arts were carried in England at a remote period.

¹ The precise period when the use of the organ was introduced into Britain has not
been ascertained3 it is supposed to have been first used in France in 757. Compare
Ann. Fr. breves; Ann. Francorum ; and Eginh. Anu. Pepini3 which concur in naming
that year as the date of the introduction. Eginhard also mentions the arrival in France
of a priest from Venice, who was able to construet organs, in 8263 but the instrument
does not appear to have been generally used in Western Europe before the Xth cent.
At that period Elphegus, Bp. &Vinchesten constructed an organ, the melodious sounds
of which are highly commended in the verses of Wolstan. In the time of Edgar,
St. Dunstan, who died 988, caused ‘⁴ oryana'’ to be constructed for the church of Glas-
tonbury, according to Joh. Glaston. ; and in that of Malmesbury, where he bestowed
‘⁴ oryana, ubi per ereas fistulas· musicis mensuris elaboratas (ludum conceptas follis
vomit ansius auras.’' W. Malmesb. Life of Aldhelm, Bp. Shirburn, founder of Mahnes-
bury Abbey. Numerous curious particulars are recorded respecting the use of organs
in England‚ as at St. Alban’s, in Cott. MS. Nero, D. VII. ; and Croyland‚ where there
were ‘⁴ oryana solennia in introita ecclesie superius situata,'' as well as smaller organs
in the choir. Portable instruments, called frequently regals‚ were much in use, and
representations occur in many illuminations and sculptures. A very curious repre-
sentation of the organ exists in Eadwine's Psalter‚ Trin. Coll. Camb. R. 17, i. and has
been copied in Strutt's Horda‚ Ι. pl. 33. Organs were imported from Flanders, as ap-
pears by the Louth accounts, about the year 1500, Archaeol. x. 91 3 the price of a pair
suitable to be set up in the rood-loft of that noble church being 5513. 68. ad. It appears
that the usual term, a pair of organs, has reference to the double bellows whereby con-
tinuous sound was produced; or, according to Douce, to their being formed with a
double row of pipes. See O’Connor’s curious observations on the early use of organs
and psalmody in the Irish church, Hib. Script. iv. 153.

curious memoir on Oriels, Archaeol. xxiii. in which he explains the varied uses of the term.
