‘2 The leeches of former times highly esteemed sternutatory powders‚ as efficacious
especially in disorders of the hrain. The root of hellebore was most in request for
this purpose, of which was formed “ neesing powder‚‘’ and the plant was called in
England, as in Germany, “ nieswoort‚⁷' according to Gerarde, who mentions also the
wild pellitory, Achillea ptarmica, as called ‘⁶ sneesewoort‚ or neesing wort.'’ Horman
says that “ two οι· iij. nesys be holsom, one is a shrowed token ;” and Palsgrave gives
the observation‚ “the physicians saye whan one neseth it 15 3 good sygne, but an yuell
cause ;” 35 likewise And. Boorde, in the Breviary of Health, c. 333, says, “ in English
it is named sternutacion, or knesing, the which 15 3 good signe of 311 euyll cause.’' He
seems, however, to approve of the moderate use of sneezing by means of the powder of
Eleborus albus, called “ knesing powder.’' In Brand’s Popular Antiqu. may be found
many curious details regarding superstitious connected with sneezing. The following
furious passage in the Golden Legend has not been noticed ; it thereby appears that a
similar superstition existed in regard to yawning. The ‘⁴ more Letanye,” it is stated,
was instituted by Pope Gregory during the pestilence called the botch, which afflicted
the people of Rome with sudden death. ‘¹ In this maner somme snesynge they deyed z
500 1111311 ony persone was herde soesinge, anone they y‘ were by sayd to him, God
helpe you, or Cryst helpe you ς and yet endureth ye custome. And also whan he snesyth
or gapeth he maketh tofore his face the sygne of the crosse, and blysseth hym, and yet
endureth this custome.’' f. xxiiij. v0. “ Nesyng with the nose, esternuement.” PALSG.
Ang.-Sax. niesan, sternutare.
