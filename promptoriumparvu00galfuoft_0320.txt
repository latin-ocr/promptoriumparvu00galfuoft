2 (ἑυΙιΤΕ, iis. In all the other MSS. as likewise in the printed editions, the word grut

is given, which seems to be the correct reading, as appears also by its place iu alphabetical
order. Aug-Sex. grem, palcis.

“ The toun dykes on every syde,

³ various etymologies have been proposed of the word gugaw, in its ordinary sense ;
“ Crepundia, toyes or gugawes for children, as rattles, clappers, διο. Junius, hy Higins.

suggests Aug-Sason gygas, auyoe, or heawgas, sinmlaclera„ or the French word jugata, but
goslar or gyogswflle seems more nearly to resemble it, and signifies, according to Roquefort,
“ bassutelle, plaisanterie. Goyogscvg se '1'422‘7'f2'v’' ἃς. It would, however, seem that the
word is here given as synonymous with flute. and the inquiry suggests itself whether it had
originally denoted some musical instrument, and thence heen used in a more general sig-
nification. According to Roquefort there was a wind instrument called frique, and this
statement corresponds with the observation of Ferrari, that [fissa. Ital. may be derived from

γίγρας, a kind of flute. It is singular that, according to Brockctt and Jamieson, a Jew’s
harp is called in N. Britain a'gewgaw, but in that instance, as likewise herev in the Promp-
torium, it seems probable that the word is used merely in reference to that with which
idle disport may be taken, like trifles in childhood.

of the introduction of engincs from which missiles were propelled 11)· means of gunpowdcr
arises chiefly from the circumstance, to which allusion is made by Selden, that the term
gun, supposed bySOn111e1· to be merely a conti-action of mmiyo, or manyma. may have
hccn used to denote some engine of war, long before the application of gunpowder to such
purpose. Mr. Douce observes that the earliest mention of “gonnes'' is found in the
Romance of Kyng Alimunder, line 32683 but in his note on that passage he says that
it must not he concluded that they were used with powder, as originally they might have
been eugines of the catapult kind. XVebcr, Metr. Rom. iii. 306. The same remark
applics to the account of the siege sustained by Kynge Aragus, who
