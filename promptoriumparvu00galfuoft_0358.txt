¹ A full account of the defensive armour called a jack is given by Sir S. Meyrick, in
his observations on ancient military garments worn in England, Archaeol. xix. 224.
Mention of it occurs as early as 1375, in the will of Thos. de Hemenhale. who devises
‘⁵ unum iakke cle 7ηώτό worstede.’' Transcripts from Norwich Registers‚ Harl. MS. 10.
Wl'alsingham relates that wat Tyler‘s mob, in the sack of John of Gaunt's palace at the
Savoy, 1381, found “ vestimentum preciosissimam ipsius, quale Iacke vocamus.” camd.
p. 249. It is mentioned in the will of Henry Snayth, clericus, 13803 “Leyo duas
loricas ferreas, (luas bacinetts cum ventall', et duas iakkys coopertas cnm fusffst' and
in 1391, Margery, widow of Sir will. de Aldeburgh‚ bequeaths to her son “unum
clvplmn cum lorz'cd interius opertum cum rubeo correo capa-02. Item, unum iak defen-
ca'om's opertum tciyro eelz-etoff’ Test. Ebor. i. 113, 150. Sir S. Meyrick questions the
authority of Nicot’s definitior) that the jack was an habiliment stuffed with cotton;
in the Catholicon Ang. however, written 1483, is given “a iakke, bombiciniumss'
Towards the close of the XVth cent. a less cumbersonie defence of a similar nature,
termed a jacket, was more in use. Palsgrave gives ⁴⁴ iacke, harnesse, icccq, ideque:
iacket, seion: iacket without sleues, leocquetorc: iacket that hath but four quarters,
iacq2cette.'' Caxton says in the Boke for Travcllers, ‘⁶ Donaas the doblet maker hath
performed my doublet and my iaquet, mon pozo-[mirate et mon polion-quest In the
accounts of the Lestrange family, 1532, are the following entries: “ Item, paid for ij.
pownd of twyn for the iacks. Item, paid for iij. eines of canvas for γ’ iack. Item,
pald to the taylour for the wurkmanshippe of iij. iachs, im. iv.d. Item, paid for
twyn sor 3our iacks. Item, paid to Matthew Smith (or the smith) for making of plates
for the iackes, iv.s. ij.d.'' The kind ofjack to which this last entry relates is described
in Lily's Euph. Eng. where it is said that the armour of the English consists of “ eors-
lets, Almaine rivets, shirts of male, iackes quffled, and covered over with leather, fustian,
or canvas, over thick plates of yron that are sowed to 56 same.'' It seems to have been
identical with the brigandine. The jack may even have been occasionally formed with
mail; in Edw. III. i. 2, Capell's Prolus. are mentioned “jacks of gymold mail.''
Thus Florio explains ‘⁶ Giacco, a iaeke of maile, made like a corslet‚ a iacket or shirt of
maile. Gitzclzetlcc, a iacket οι· shirt of maile :” and Cotgrave gives ‘⁴ quue, a iacke or
coat of mail, and thence a iaeke for the body of an Irish greyhound‚ διο. made commonly
of a wild boares tanned skinne, and put on him when he is to coap with that violent
beast.” The sense in which baltheus is used in the Promptorium is singulam it signifies
commonly a girdle, but here com ARMURE, DOBBELET, and PALTOK, military garmentS,
are rendered by the term baltheus.

Iangyller,flctilis‚ poliloqzms, ὡς. ulfi chaterynge.” CATH. ΛΜΞ. “ I iangyll, ie babille, ie
cacrlwelte: she iangleth lykc a iayes' PALSG. To jangle occurs in the sense of chaum-ing
in the Vis. of Piers Plouglim.; Clmucer, Man of Lawcs Tale, 519³„ Gower. &a “ lanyler,
to janglc. prattle, tattle saucily, or scurvily.” COTG.
