¹ This term is used by Chaucer, Legend of Good Women,Pr01. 358, and is taken
from the Freneh. “ Lau(e)nd1·e‚ a wasslmr, lauendiere. Laundre that wassheth clothes‚'’
id. PALSG. ⁴¹ Candizlczria, lotrix Ῑπίηιῡονῑιηῑ, a wasshere, and a lavyndere.” MED. “ Al-
Imm-xx, canalidaria, blecherre, orlawnderreff’ Vocab. Harl. MS. 1587. “A lawnder,
mmlidaria, lotrix.” CATH. ANG. Caxton says, in the Bolze for Travellers‚ ‘⁶ Beatrice
the lauendre shall come hethir after diner, so gyne her the lynnen clothis.'' W. Thomas,
in his Rules of Ital. Gmmmar, gives “ ἰαῑιαηίῖαία, a launder that wassheth cloathes.⁷’
See Jamieson, v. Layndar.

² The precise nature of this weapon, as likewise the etymology of its name, is still
questionable3 it was probably adopted in this country from the Freneh, but the deri-
vation from the name of an Eastern or Moorish weapon, called 2‘'.‘l⁴'.²l02 (ιν-ἔφαγε, or
11.3s‹1gy(1y‚seenis more reasonable than that which has been proposed, lance ac'gyiIe. That
it was a missile weapon is apparent from Guill. de St. Andre, who wrote about the
middle of the XIVth cent. and speaks of throwing ‘⁶ ‹lm-des, jae-elom, ἰανθείς-θυμω ,·” but
Guiart seems to mention the “archcyaie '¹ as a thrusting xveapon, rather than a mis-
sile. Cam-6 gives a comparison of the Laszce-ffltaye‚ or urclcfffflcgle, of the Franks, with
the Oriental zagaye, and considers them as missiles. Armes des Franqais, p. 198. From
“ the Rime of Sire Thopas‚” which describes him as going forth to ride with “ a launee-
gay ’' in his hand and long sword at his side, it appears to have been a weapon carried
for occasional defenee, rather than a proper part of equipment for war or the tom-na-
ment.'' Cant. T. 13‚6S2. The stat. 7 Rie. ΙΙΙ. o. 13. confirming the stat. [of North-

Ric. II. c. 1; Stat. of Realm, ii. 35, 92. In the Rolls of Parl. V. 212, there isa
petition for vengeance by the widow of a person who had been murdered in 1450 by
a gang of men “ arraied in fourme of werre, with jakkes, salettez, longe swerdes, long-
debeofs, boresperes, and other unmerciable forbodon wopons‚’' one of whom “smote
him with a launeegay thorough the body, a fote and more.’⁷ In 1459 there were
found in the Great Hall of Sir John Fastolfe, at Caistor, Norfolk‚ oross-bows‚ a boar-
spear, a target, ‘⁴ xxj. speris: Item, j. launcegay.’' Archaeol. xxi. 272. “Launee gay,
