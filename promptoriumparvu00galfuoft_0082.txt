lxviii APPENDJX.

(12.) “ Liber Equivocorum vocabulorum,” by John de Gau-lancha.—
Amongst grammatical treatises by this author, of whom some account has
been given pp. xxvi—xxxii. supra, this and the “ Synonyma’' claim no-
tice on account of the English words occurring in the commentary or
“ expositio, attributed to the author of the Promptorium. There are
numerous MSS. of both works, of which also several editions were printed
by Wynkyn de Worde and Pynson, See Hei-bert, and Dibdin, Typ. Ant.
vol. ii. pp. 96, 406. I have consulted chiefly the edition by W. de Worde,
Lond. 1499. As a specimen of the work and of the accompanying carpo-

sz'tio by Galfridus, the learned recluse of Lynn, I may cite the following
curious passage :—

Η

“ Fungus boletus et fungus dicitur ales.

‘⁴ Ἥ Hic docet autor quod fungus habet duas significationes. Nam fun-
gus id est boletus ε anglice paddokstole. Vel est quedam avis anglice an
ostrich ε quia ut aliqui dicunt est illa qui comedit ferrum .i. ferreos claves 2
anglice horsenayles. Ἣ Fungus dicitur a fungor, fungeris, secundum
vocem: sed a defungor, defungeris, secundum significationem, defungor
id est mori, quia comedentes fungos, sicut plures faciunt in partibus trans-
marinis, sepius moriuntur. Unde Marcialis cocus,—

Defunctos fungis hominis materne negabis,
Boleti leti causa fuere tui.”

(13). “ Synonyuna,'’ by John de Garlandia.—-This work, formerly, as
was also that last mentioned, in high esteem for instruction of scholars,
has been already noticed. See p. xvii„ supra. I have made use chiefly
of the edition by W. de Worde, 1500, “cum expositione magistri Gal-
fridi Anglici,'' namely, the author of the Promptorium, whose commentary

Hereford Sehool, about 13733 Sloane MS. 5. A version printed by Robert VVyer,
without date, describes this Herbal as “ practys’ d by Doctor Lynacre.’' See Ames's Typ.
Ant. p. 158.

²³ It may deserve notice that the “ Poetria nova‚” ascribed by Pits to Galfridus Gram-
maticus, as stated p. xviii. supra, but probably written by Galfridus Vinesauf, as Bishop
Tanner observes, seems to have been regarded at this time as a production of the former.
Under the word “ sanguis '⁹ is the explanation—“ est idem quod progenies. Unde Gal-
fridus in Poetria, autor istius libri,—-Egregius sanguis te confert Bartholomei.'' 11⁰ this
passage, however, may be taken as referring to the Friar of Lynn, it is obvious that we
must ascribe it to some later commentator, by whom additions were made to his expositio.
