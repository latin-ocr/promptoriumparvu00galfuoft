without any explanatory comment3 and the Editor is
apprehensive that the elucidations which he has been
enabled to offer will too frequently be found insufficient
or defective. In a work that has demanded much minute
research and detailed reference, numerous errors must,
with the utmost care, have occurred 3 and he will thank·
fully appreciate any corrections or suggestions with which
those who are interested in such researches may favour
him. Considerable inconvenience has arisen from the
impossibility of gaining access to treatises from which the
Latin words in the Promptorium were derived. The
author cited as ‘⁶ Mirivalensis, in Campo florum,’' is
unknown, and all researches in order to discover that
work, which supplied many of the most curicus and
obscure terms, have hitherto been fruitless. No MS. of
the Derivationes Ugucionis has yet been found which
answers to the description here given, “ Ugucio versifi-
catus ;'' and the ‘⁶ Commentarius curialium '’ is likewise
still a desideratum. On these points of difficulty the
Editor, in behalf of his endeavour to offer in the present
work some contribution towards the archaic lexicography
of the English language‚ would solicit the aid of those

who are more conversant than himself with early MS.
literature.
