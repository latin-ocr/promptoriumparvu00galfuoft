⁴ This word is still of local use to denote the commotion caused in some tidal rivers,
at the flow of the tide. In the Ouse, near Downham bridge, above Lynn, the name is
eager, as also in the Nene, between XVisbeach and Peterborough‚ and the Ouse near York,
and other rivers. Camden calls the meeting of the Avon and Severn, higre. Compare
Skinner, under the word eager. In Craven Dial. acker is a ripple on the water. Aker
seemS‚ however, to have had a more extended meaning, as applied to some turbulent
eurrents, or commotions of the deep. The MS. Poem entitled Of Knyghthode and
Batayle, Cott. MS. Titus A. XXIII. f. 49, eommending the skill ol' mariners in judging
of the signs of weather, makes the following allusion to the aker.

“ Wel know they the remue yf it a-ryse,
An aker is it clept, I vnderstonde,
VVhos myght there may no shippe or wynd wyt stonde.
This remue in th'oeeian of propre kynde
Wyt oute wynde hathe his commotioun;
The maryneer theros may not be blynde,
But when and where in euery regioun
It regnethe, he moste haue inspectioun‚
For in viage it may bothe haste and tary,
And vnavised thereos, al mys cary.''

Aker seems to be derived from ΑΒ. ae, water, and cer, a turn3 sae-eir signifies the ebb
of the sea. CAEDM. See Nares, under Higre.
