¹ In the Harl. MS„ which has been used as the text in preparing this edition of the
Promptorium,no uniform rule appears to have been laid down in regard to the use of the
Anglo-Saxon character l), in place of which Th constantly occurs, probably through
carelessness of the transeriber. Here, however, the words thus commencing are found in
the usual position assigned to b, towards the close of the Anglo-Saxon alphabct; each
being accompanied by the same word, written with Th, as if its more recondite or
archaic form required such explanation. These circumstances are not undeserving of
notice. In the King's College MS. the repetition is not found, the words being written
with l’ only. In the Middle Hill MS. they are written thus—Yanne or thann-Yowtyng
or thowtyng, the character Y being uniformly used in that MS. instead of b. In the Win-
chester MS. b is commonly, but not invariably, used throughout, and the words in this
portion of the alphabet are written without uniformity. Pynson and Julian Notary printed
invariably with Y for b, and, in the copy of the rare edition by the former in the Royal
Library‚ British Museum, the following MS. note is found : “ All these Y. stande for Th.
acordinge as the Saxon carr-acte was in this sorte—b, and so we pronounce all these
wordes at this day with Tl1.” In W. de Worde's edit. 1516, the whole of the above are
omitted, and, immediately after the alphabetical section W, follow Ya, Yanynge, δια, to
the close, printed with Y. instead of 3, as in all the other texts which have been available
for collation. This may, however, be merely a typographical error.

3ee, infra, p. 537, where the reading in other MSS. and in Pynson’s text is “seyn 3e with
wombep, or worship.” The learned advocate Pasquier, in his Recherches de la France
(liv. viii. c. 4), has discussed the origin of the use of the pronoun singular as an addi-ess
of familiarity or contempt, and of the pronoun plural in accordance with respect due to
superiore. The practise of cutoyaqe in ‘France between relations or familiar friends, and in
