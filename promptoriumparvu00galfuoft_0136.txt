MS. 18 A. VI. f. 68, where it is said to be “ also clepyd byschuppyswort.'' Hor-man
observes that “nesynge is caused with byten (betonica) thrust in the nostril.'' The
powdered root of hellebore was another honiely sternutatory anciently much in request.

'-' “fllereudnla, a beuer after none. Merenda, comestio in meridie vel cibas qui
declinante <lie sumiturs’ ORT. Harrison. in his description of Eugland, prefixed to
Holinshed’s Chronicles, i. 170, remarks that “of old we had breakefastes in the fore-
noone, beuerages or nuntions after dinner, and thereto reare suppers, generallie when
it was time to go to rest, a toie brought into England by hardie Canutus; but nowe
those are very well past, and ech one, except some yoong hungrie stomach that cannot
fast till dinner time, contenteth himself with dinner and supper.’' The higher classes,
he observes, dine at 11 and sup at 5, merehants seldom before 12 and 6. This was
written about 1579. Sherwood renders, ‘⁶ Bever, or drinking, un re'cz'ner, εοῖἶαίἰοη,
yonstcr. To bever, rebium-,³¹ and Cotgrave explains un reciner as “an afternoones
nuneheon‚ or collation, an Aunders-meat.’' See hereafter NUNMETE, which seems to
have been much the same as the intermediate refection here called BEUER. The word
bever still signifies in Suffolk an afternoon snack. MOORE.

³ As. beofer‚ castor. That the beaver was anciently an inhabitant of these islands.
the laws of Howel Dha, and the curious description of its habits given by Giraldus, in
his Itinerary of Wales, l. ii. c. 3, satisfactorily prove. The fur of this animal was in
estimation from an early period. Piers Ploughman says,

‘⁵ And yet ycnder that eope, a cote hath he fun-ed
With foyuS, or with fichewes, or with syn benere.''
