“ He saied, he had a gobbet of the saile
That Sainct Peter had, when that he went
Upon the sea, till Jesu Christ him hent.” Cant. Τ. Prol.

Sir John Maundevile says of the apples of paradise, growing in Egypt, “and thoghe
3ee kutte hem in never so many gobettes or partie& overthwart, or end-longes, evvre-
more 3ee schulle fynden in the myddes the figure of the Holy Cros.'’ p. (30. ‘⁴ Glelna, a
gobet of erthe.’' MED. “Gobbet, a lumpe, or a pece, monceau, Iopen, chantem?
PALSG. The derivation appears to be from ‘² Gobeau, a bit, gobbet, or morsell.'' COTG.

¹ “A goffe, ubi a godefader. A gome, ubi a godmoder.” CATH. ANG. In the North
goff signifies a fool, according to Brockett and Jamieson. Cotgrave gives ⁴⁶ commem,
a she-gossip, or godmother, a g01nme,’' but the term appears to be now obsolete.

² The interjection Goddot, Goddoth, occurs frequently in Havelok the Dane; Sir F.
Madden, in his Glossary appended to that curious poem, supposes it to be a corruption
of God wot! formed in the sanie manner as Goddil for God's will, in Yorkshire and
Lancashire3 a conjecture which appeared to be confirmed by the following passage,
where it is related that Havelok made a vow to found a priory,

‘⁴ And therof held he wel his oth,
For he it made, God it woth l ” line 2527.

The word, it is further observed, appears to have been limited to Lincolnshire or Lan-
eashire, and a single instance of its occurrence is cited fromn. poem written in the
former county, t. Edw. I. From the form, however, ot* the word, as it occurs in the
Promptorium, the derivation appears to be more obviously from A.-Sax. geatam, concedere.

³ This term occurs in the Wieliffite version, Mark ix. 46; “ If thiu yghe selaundre
thee, caste it out3 it is bettre to thee to entre gogil-yghed (lasz-mn, Vulg.) into the
rewnie of God, than have tweyne yghen,'' διο. Palsgrave gives among the adverbs, “ a
goggell, en loncscet. Goggle-eyed man, lovclce.'' Junius thinks it may be derived from
A.-s. scegl egede‚ strabo.

⁴ In some parts cf England a piece of projecting iron at each end of a roller, which
connects it with the frame, is still called a gudgeon, from the Fr. “youjon, the pin
which the truckle of a pulley runneth on ; also the gudgeon of the spindle of a whcele.''
