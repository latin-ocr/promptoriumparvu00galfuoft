³ See CAMPY’N’. In ancient deeds cited in the Hist. of Hengrave, p. 11, mention occurs
of “ le camping close,'' near Fornham St. Genevieve, where Montl'ort, Earl of Leicester‚
was defeated in 11733 and the name has been supposed to have some connection with that

game of the Eastern counties. Sir Thos. Brown gives to kamp in his list of Norfolk words.
Tusser speaks of the game‚ in December's Husbandry‚ as beneficial to grass land. In a
publication by M. Stevenson‚ 1673, entitled “ Norfolk drollery,¹' is 3 poem in reference to
this ancient game, and it is fully described by Forby.

area in littore, e compactis tabulis trabibusque, clavium imnumfirmata. δατ. caeg‚'' clavis.
