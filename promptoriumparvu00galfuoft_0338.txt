Version¹ eze. In the Golden Legend it is related that St. Amphyabel “ prayed Albon of
liei-horough for the love of God; whiehe Albon without faynynge, as he 51 alwaye
loued to do hospytalyte, graunted hym herberough‚ and well receyued hym.” Caxton
says, in the Boke for Travellers, “ (irrete me the damyselle of your hous, or of your
he(r)berow‚ vostre leostel.” The verb is used by Sir John Mauudevile in the sense
both of giving and receiving hospitality3 he 5:255, speaking of Bethany, “ there dwelte
Symon leprous, and there herberwed our Lord, and aftre he was baptised ot' the Apos-
tles, and was clept Julyan, and was made Bisschoppe; and this 15 the same Julyan that
men clepe to for gode‘herherghage, for our Lord herbervved with him in his hows.'’
Yoiage, p. 116. 'l'he adjective herberous has the signification of hospitable. In the
version prefixed to the translation of the paraphrase of Titus by Erasmus, it occurs as
follows: “A bysshop must be such as no man can complaine oti—not geuen to filthy
lucre, but l1erber0us‚” 640. Titus, i. 83 printed by Johan Byddell, t. Heu. VIII. 'she
remarkable 1101110 Cold-harbour, which occurs repeatedly in most counties at places ad-
jacent to Roman reads, or lines of early communication, seems to have been derived
from the station there established3 but of the strange epithet thereto prefixed no satis-
factory explanation has yet been suggested. See Hartshorne’s Salopia Antiqua, p. 253.

² This term is derived from a sort of pyramidal canfflesdck, or frame for supporting
