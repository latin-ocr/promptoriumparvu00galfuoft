¹ Clepsz'clra is explained in the Ortus to be the same as “ clocz'llus‚ Atiqqlice a perser
or a spygote.'' See DOTTELL, dosseH, above. “Faucet‚ to drawe xvyne, faucet, broche
ὰ eston-per le vinff’ PALSG. This word is derived from the Freneh, saulcel.

² “A fawchone, rumphea, framea, spatu.'' CATH. ANG. This appellation of a
sword with a curved blade is taken from the Freneh fauckon, a diminutive of fiam,
from the Latin fille. The sauclaon 15 frequently mentioned by Guiast, who 111-010 at
the close of the XIlIth cent. and seems to have been identical with the falso, often
named at that period, and the fille-io, which is included among weapons that monks
were forbidden to bear by the Stat. Cistert. Ord. A.D. 1202. An early instance of the
use of this weapon occurs in the curious designs of temp. devard I. discovered in the
Painted Chamber at Westminster‚ given in the Vetusta Monumenta. XVhen Lauufal

is 3551111011 by the lords of Lombmdy, in unequal conflict,

“ Sir Launfal brayde out hys foehon,
And, as ly3t as dewe, he layde hem donne.'’

Launfal Miles. Cott. MS. Calig. A. ΙΙ.

It must be observed‚ however, that the fuucleon and falso seem oceasionally to be
named with long-handled weapons, and that the falehion may occasionally have been a
kind of bill, with the curved or scythe-shaped blade whence the name was taken.
