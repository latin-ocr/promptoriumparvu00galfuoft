especially for the out-watch by night, ·‘ be whiche must be departede in foure quarters
of be nyght, the whiche quarters most be departede by the orlageres (ad clepsydram

¹ Le Grand d'Aussy, Vie Privee des Francais‚ i. 246, could not trace the introduc-
tion of the orange to an earlier period than 1333. It is said to have been brought from
China by the Portuguese, but it is more probable that its introduction into Europe is
due to the Arab conquerors of Spain. A document preserved in the Tower, and cited
in the valuable Introduction to Household Expenses in England, presented to the
Roxburghe Club by B. Botfield, Esq. records that in 1290 a large Spanish ship arrived
at Portsmouth‚ from the cargo of which Queen Eleanor purchased a frail of Seville figs,
dates, pomegranates, 15 citmns, and “ vij. poma de oren-qest A full account of the

Trevisa likewise, in his version of the Polychron. speaks of “ an orped man, and stall-

Β. xu. f. 63, b. Dowglas‚ the monk of Glastonbury, in his Chronicle‚ Harl. MS.
4690, speaks of the conflict of Edw. III. with the Normans in 1347, ‘⁴ atte the brigge
of Cad0n‚ manly and orpedly strengthed and defended,” f. 8⁶23 and again, in his re-
lation of the hasty expedition of Edw. III. to Calais, 1350, says that ‘⁸ he towke wil>

was called also in French orpz'n. “ Orpyn, an herbe, orpz'n.'' PALSG. Skinner would
derive the name from Belg. oor psme, aurium dolor, in allusion to its narcotic properties.
