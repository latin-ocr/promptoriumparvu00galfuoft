Page 5, b. line 26, for A—eethen, read A-cethe. The word is written in the Harl. MS.
a-cethe, but the final contractiori must be regarded as an error of the transcript. In
the Winch. MS. it is written “ a-cethe.'' Compare Fulfyllyir, or make a-cethe in
thynge bat wantythe, p. 182 ; and Make a-cethe, p. 321.

Page 7, a, line 23, after Affynyte the word A-foyste, lirida, occurs here, as stated in the
note; it was thought to be possibly misplaced. Compare Fyyst, lirida, p. 163, a.

Affyste, lirida, vesiculacio, secundum adamantem.

Page 8, note 4, in the quotation from the metrical paraphrase of Vegecius, Cott. MS.
Titus A. xxm. the word “ remue ’¹ should apparently be read ‘¹ reume :'' in the ori-
ginal, “ rheuma.’' Compare the curious version attributed to Trevisa, Roy. MS. 18.
A. XII. where the word is thus rendered : “ This ebbing and flowing that is callede
rewme of the see.'¹ Β. iv. c. 42. See also Lansd. MS. 285, f. 136, b. In the French
version attributed by Caxton to Christine de Pise the word is translated ‘⁴ rheume.’'
Akyr, Eagre, Higre, or Agar, is a name to be traced probably to that of the great
Ocean-god of the Northern Mythology, Oegir or AEgir; the drowned were the prey of
Rr‘m, his consort. In Lyly's Galathea is the following allusion to the Akyr: “ He
[Neptune] seudeth a monster called the Agar, against whose coming the waters roare,
the fowles flie away, and the cattle of the field, for terror, shun the banks.'’ Finn
Magnussen derives AEgir from the verb aegia, to fiow.

Page 15, note 3. It should be observed that the printed volume cited in this note, and
elsewhere, as Mr. VVilbraham's Latin-English Dictionary‚ has been ascertained to be
Pynson's edition of the Ortus, described in the Preface, p. lvii. The variations in
the rendering of Cim'flo, in MSS. of the Medulla Grammatice, are given in the Pre-
face, p. xxii. See also the note, ibid. In a Nominale xv. cent. in the possession of
Mr. Joseph Mayer, F.S.A., and edited by Mr. Thomas VVrightfin his Volume of
Vocabularies, cap. 4, p. 212, “ Nomina dignitatum laicorum,’¹ occurs, amongst
servants, “ Hic cimifio (sic) a nask-kyste,’' namely, as Mr. Wright explains it, ‘¹ the
askfyse‚ the servant who made and blew the fire.'' Hexham gives, in his “ Nether-
dutch '' and English Dictionary‚ 1648, “Assehe—vijster‚ one that sits alwayes on the
hearth, hanging his head over the ashes.''
