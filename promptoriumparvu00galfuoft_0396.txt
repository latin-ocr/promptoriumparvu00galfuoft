¹ In the accounts of works at the palace of &Vestminster and the Tower during the
XIVth cent. preserved amongst the miscellaneous records of the Queen’s Remem-
brancer, mention is made continually of “montona'' or stone layers. See also the
absh-acts of accounts relating to the erectior] of St. Stephen's Chapel, in the reign of
Edw. III. printed in Smith's Antiqu. of Westm. In the contract for building Fother-
ing-hay Chul-ch, 1425, the chief mason undertakes neither to “set mo nor 1011·οι- free-

et cineri? Arund MS. 508. The early romances and Chaucer's poenis afford evidence
that yellow or light-coloured hair was in especial esteem. The fashion prevailed ata
very early period, as appears from the writings of Tertullian, who reproaches Christian
women with an affectation of seeking to resemble in this respect those of Germany and
Gaul. The art of producing this colour artificially was termed crcwzeplmntew, and is
condemned by St. Cyprian and St. Jerome as asinful vanity, and by Galen as preju-
dicial to health. At the time when the Promptorium was compiled this fashion con-
tinued 111 full force, and numerous artificial expedients had been devised for supplying
the defect of nature, by means of some vegetable decoction or lie, wherehy, with sub-
sequent exposure to the sun, the hair might be made to assume the desii-ed colour. The
herbals and medicinal treatises of the XVth cent. indicate a great variety of processes
which were adopted for colouring or preserving the hair. In Arundel MS. 42,f. 82,
the decoction of madder is recommended to make it red, and the juice of sage applied
in the hot sun to make it black 3 f. 77, b. The virtues of the lily are commended for
making hair to grow again, and the oil of hazel nuts as infallihle against ‘⁶ mowtynge
ofhe1·e‚⁷' f. 593 and an effectual depilatory ‘⁴ for-doyng here'’ is given at f. 35. The
strangest substances were in request for such purposes: thus in Jul. D. vlll. f. 79, b.
“lixivium de cinero ,Τῐιηιῗ ςυὶῑ(1ηὒί” 15 recommended as an approved remedy against
the falling of hair. The extent to which such artificial aids were made availahle ata
later period appears from the numbcrless prescriptions given by Gerar-de, Parkinson,
Langham, in his Garden of Health, 1579, and similar writers. See the satirieal ob-
servations of Bulwer on this subject, in the Artificial Changling‚ 1653. Horman, who
wrote at the commencement 01³ the reign of ch. VIII. says that “maydens were
sylken callis, with the whiche they keepe 111 01·(11·0 theyr heare made yelowe with lye3
