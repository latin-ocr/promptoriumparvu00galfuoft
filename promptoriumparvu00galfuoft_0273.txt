Fourceler, to clip or shear. See ROQUEF. The stat. 8 chry VI. c. 20, forbids the

those who “clukkent et forcent les boues luins (lu roiulnte, pur eux curie)- dehors divelle

¹ This verb, Ang.-Sax. for-dou, perdere, occurs in the Vision of P. Ploughman.

‘¹ Alias ! that drynke shal for-do
That God deere boughte.'’ line 5284.

In the Golden Legend it is said in the Life of Becket‚ that Henry ΙΙ, “ wolde fot-(loo
suche lawes as his oldres hadde vsed to·fore hym.'' Palsgrave says, “What so cuer
he do on the one day, on the morowe I wyll fordo it, clefaire.”

² Jocelyn de Brakelonda relates in his Chronicle, p. 84, that Abbot Samson examined
the relies of St. Edmund in 1198, and when the shrine was closed up, “positus est
super loculum forulus quidam sericus, in quo deposita fuit scedula An'qlt‘ce scriptu,
continens quasdam salutaciones Az'lwt'rti Monacht,” with a memorial of the opening of
the shrine, which was subscribed by all who had been present. Foruli, according to
Papias, are “cleecae vel εἰδέω librorum, tabularum, vel aliarum rerum, ut spatae,· dictae,
quod de foris teyunt‚·’' in French, fourrwu, οι· fourel, has the like meaning. Horman
8³58, “I hadde leuer haue my boke sowed in a sorel (consuatur iu cuculli invo-
lucro) than bounde in bourdis, and couerede, and cthsed, and gat-nysshed with
bolyens.” Jennings, in his Observations on the Dialects of the West, states that the
cover of a book is still termed a forrel. Palsgrave gives “ coueryng for a book, chemi-
setee,’' a term which appears to be synonymous with foreHe, and which has been ex·-
plained by Charpentier, v. Cumisiu libri. In an Inventory taken at Notre Dame,
Paris, in 1492, is mentioned “ zmypctt't messal convert <le cuir rouye, fsto-ui clune cltemz'-
secte cle chevrotin rouyefi Two of the mourncrs, whose figures are seen around the
tomb of Richard Beauchamp, at W'arwick, hold each a book, wrapped in the forelle, or
chemise-uffi- see Stothard⁸s Monumental Effigies. Its fashion is more clearly exhibited in
a picture at Munich, by Schorel, which has furnished the subject of a plate in Shaw's
Dresses and Decorations.

³ This verb is derived from the Ang--Sax. for, which often gives in composition the
sense of privation or deterioration, and fandian, tentare. “God forl'ende it!’' PALSG.
To forhinder, signifying to prevent, is retained in the East-Anglian dialect, according
to Forby. Many other words similarly componudcd have become wholly obsoleto, sc-
