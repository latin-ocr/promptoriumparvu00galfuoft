¹ “ Facina, a forspekere, οι· a tylstere (αἱ. tylyere). Fasciuo, to forspeke or ouersee.”
MED- GRAMM. ‘⁶ To forspeke, fascinare, ἐπανῄειν-ε,- a forspekynge, saseinacio,ficcinus.’'
CATH. ANG. Palsgrave sayS, ‘⁴ Ι forspeake a thyng by enehauntementes. Some witche
hath forspoken him, quelque wude-yse la enclccmte‘J’ W. Turner, in his Hei-bal, 1562,
says that ‘⁴ there are sum date trees in whose fruite is a stone bowyng after ye fasshon of
an half moon, and thys sum polyshe with a toothe, with a oertayn religion agaynst for-
spekyng and hewitchyng.'' The Aug-Sari. for-spaec has merely the signification of a
preface‚ fore-spem, preconator,- by Shakespeare and other writers to sorespeak is used
with the sense of forbidding. The use of the word in the sense of fascinating or eharming
arose probably from a superstitious belief, which is not extinet at the present time in
North Britain, that certain persons had the power of injuring or bewitehing others by
immoderate praise. See Jamieson’s observations upon this word.

² Richard Earl of Arumlel, having made in Parliament certain complaints against John
of Gaunt‚ which were answered by Richard 11„ the Earl was obliged to make before the
House an apology‚ which was enrolled, wherein he thus expresses himself: “ Hit for-
thynketh me, and byseehe yowe of your gode Lordship to remyt me your man-talent.'’
Rot. Parl. 111. 314, A.D. 1393. “ To rewe, penitere, estc. ubi to forthynke. A for-
thynkynge, compunccio, contricio, penitencz'a.'’ CATH. ANG.

³ In the romanoe of Richard Coer de Lion it is related that Saladin made a treaty with
him that for three years pilgrims should have free aeeess to the holy city.

“ The next day he made forewarde
Of trewcs to the Kyng Richard.” line 7115.
In Sir Amadaee the White Knight makes an agreement in these terms;

“ Butte a forwart make I with the, or that thou goe,
That euyn to part be-twene vs toe,
The godus thou hase wonun and spedde.'’ Stanza 42.

Ang.-Sax. fore-weard, pactum.

⁴ “ For ye naynste‚ (cb-inccnlo.” CATH. ANG. Various are the conjectures that have
been made with rogarii to the derivation of this phrase. See 'l'yrwhitt's note on Cant.
