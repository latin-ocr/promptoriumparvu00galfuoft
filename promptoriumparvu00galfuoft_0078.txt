(3.) ‘⁶ Catholicon in Lingua niaterna.''—The valuable English-Latin
Dietionarjx frequently cited in the notes to this edition of the Prompto-
rium as the “ Catholicon Anglicumj' is a MS. which was kindly confided
to 1110 in 1841 by Lord Monson, as before stated.a Its contents are
wholly distinct fron] those of the Promptorium3 the nouus, verbs, and
other parts of speech are arranged consecutively in alphabetical order,
instead of forming, as in the Promptorium, a Nominale and a Verbale.
The MS. consists of 16 “ quaterni,’' 01· 192 leaves; dimensions 83inches
by 6. At the end of the Dictionary, which forms 183 leaves, are the fol-
lowing note and colophon:

“ Nota.— Quum ad utilitatem et comodum singulorum, in grammatica
precipue proficere cupiencium, hanc brevem et suinmariam tabulam
extractam (10 tabula prescripta Catholicon breviter nuncupatur in linguam
maternam, Deo disponente, disposui, sic jain proferre respicienti seu
studenti, supplicans si qua in ea reprehensione digna invenerit, aut corrigat,
aut oculis clausis pertranseat, aut saltem humane ignorancie imputet.
ἾῙ Sed inquirendo quisque prudenter caveat, tum de variacione linguarum

² See Advertisement, p. x. I recall with pleasure that my attention was directed to this
remarkable MS. by a valued friend at Lincoln, the late ΜΓ. E. J. Willson, by whom it
had been cited as explanatory osa few architectura} tei-ms.
