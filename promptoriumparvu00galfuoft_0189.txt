¹ The usage of distributing year by year a robe, or some external token of adherence
to the service or interests of the personage by whom such general retainer was granted,
appears to have commenced during the XIIIth century. The gift, whetherarobe‚ a
hood, or other outward sign, was termed a livery, liberata, and the practice was carried to
so pernicious an extent, that various statutes passed in the reigns of Edward III. Ri-
chard 11. and Henry IV. by which the use of liveries was restricted or regulated. Mr.
Beltz, in his curious article on the Collars of the King's Livery, Retrosp. Review, N. S.
ii. 500, states that the first instance on record of conferring such marks of distinction
in England is in 1390, when Richard II. distributed his cognisance of the white hart,
but the assertion copied from Anstis, that it was pendant from a collar of broom-cods,
does not appear to rest on any authority. This collar was, however, presented in 1393
to Richard II. and his three uncles by Charles VI. King of France, whose cognisance it
was. Such a “colare del livere clu Ros de Fraunce '⁹ is mentioned in the Inventories of
the Exchequer Treasury, vol. iii. 357. See Mr. J. G. Nichols’s interesting observations
on the Effigies of Richard II. and his Queen, Archaeol. xxix. 46. The earliest notice
of collars of livery, that has been observed, occurs in Rot. Parl. iii. 313, where it appears
that when John of Gaunt returned in 1389 from the wars in Spain and Gascony.
Richard took his uncle's ‘¹ livere de coler” from his neck, and wore it himself; that it
was also worn by some of the King’s retinue; and that Richard declared in Parliament
that he wore it in token of affection, as likewise lie wore the liveries of his other uncles.
It is not improbable that this livery of the Duke of Lancaster’s was the collar of letters
of SS, subsequently adopted by Henry IV. as his livery, the origin of which is still
involved in obscurity. This device had been in use many years before his accession,
and as early as 1373 Sir John de Foxle, whose will is preserved in Bishop WVykeham’s
Register at WVinchesten bequeathed “lilonz'le auri, cum S litere} sculpi& et amelini in
eodem.'' The livery of Henry V. during the life-time of his father, was a swan, adopted
doubtless in token of his descent from the Bohun family; the Stat. 2 Hen. IV. c. 21,
contains a clause “ que Alonseiynezcr le Prince parra doner sa honorable liveree del
C'z'yne as set'ssneurs etases mez'ynalx ye2ztilx; '' and such were probably the “ Colers
d'aryent de la livere du Royst which are enumerated in the Inventories of the effects of
Henry V. taken at his decease, 1423. Rot. Parl. iv, 214. Henry VI. used a collar
formed of broom-cods and the letter S alternately, and Edward IV. adopted as his li-
very a collar'of suns and ωερε, to which a white lion was appended. There is no evi-
dence that collare of livery were ever distributed by subjeets, excepting the Princes of
the blood.
