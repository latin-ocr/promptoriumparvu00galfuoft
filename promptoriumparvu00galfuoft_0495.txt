2 ‘¹ A perke, pertzca.‘’ CATH. ANG. Amongst the ancient furniture of the chamber
the perch appears to have answered the same purpose as the clothes-horse of later
times. The falconer had likewise his perch, whereon the hawks were accustomed to
sit. In the dictionary composed by Joh. de Gall-«india it is said, “ Supra perticam
maqistrz' Jolcannis diversa indumenta pendent.- tunice, supertunicalia, pallia, scopu-
Iaria. capa, coopertorium, lintheamina, renones, sarabarre, stroqule, carniste, brac-ce,
bumbiez'nia et tapeta‚’¹ διας audit is added in the Gloss, “pet-lica, Gallice perche,
unde versus .- Per-tica diversos pannos retinere solebat.⁷’ Documens ine‘dt'ts : Paris sous
Philippa le Bel, ed. Geram, App. p. 603. Caxton says, in the Book ior Travellers,
amongst the appliances of the chamber, ‘⁴ On the perche hongen your clothes, man-
telles‚ frockes, clokes‚ cotes, doblettes‚ furres, wynter clothes and of somer‚” &a In
Norfolk a perch, or a wooden frame, against which sawn timber is set up to dry, is
called, according to Forby, a perk.

³ This term appears to designate a wax candle of certain dimensione, such as it was
customary to place on the pertica or petyula, a small transverse beam or bar, whereon
in churches or other places candles were affixed. Edw. Phillips, in the World of
VVords, states that perchers were the same as Paris candle, anciently used in England,
also a bigger sort of candles, commonly set upon the altars. According to the ancient
assise recorded in the Alemorz'ale multorum of Henry, Prior of Canterbury‚ 1285—1331.
Cott. MS. Galba, E. 1v. f. 45, the Sacrist was bound to provide for the Prior’s chamber
cereos of the weight of halfa lb. each, candelas. ⁶2⁴ to the pound, torticios, 2 ells in
length, and weighing 5lb. each, with smaller ones of different weights, some of which
had the appellation ‘⁴ prikette,” being 1‘2 in. long, and weighing 8 to the pound.
‘⁴ Item, candele que vocantur perchers continent in lozzyitztdine xv. pollic’,· unde Jviij.
perchers pond' j.li. cere.'’ These appear to have been used at the l'rior's table. Thev
are thus mentioned in the metrical treatise (le Qfficiartis in curiis Dominorwn, XVth
cent. under the head “de candelaris), of the chaudelei·,’‘
