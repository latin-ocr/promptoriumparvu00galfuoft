A.D. 1450, as regards ‘⁴ a parclose of tymber '⁸ to be constructed about an orgari-lost,
to stand over the west door. Dugdale, Hist VVarW. &Valten Lord Montjoy, gives di-
rections in his will, A.D. 1474, sor the einbellishment of a chapel in Derbyshire ‘⁶ with
aquire and perclose, and two altars without yc quire.'' Testam. vet. i. 335. Blomfield
describes the “ perclose, or chapel included with cancelli or lattices,’' constructed

¹ The pardoner was an ecclesiastic author-ised by the head of the Roman Church to
travel throughout Catholic Europe for the purpose of vending pardons or indulgences,
with the intention of raising a sum for some special purpose. Chaucer, 111 his lively
portraiture of the Pardoner, Cant. T. v. 710, shows the expedients aud pretences to
which such itinerants had recourse, in turning to profitable account the superstition or
ignorance of the people, 3 practice to which a check was given by several councils.
They were termed ques-tores, or questionariz', in French questeurs. Frequent allusion
is made in the Vision of Piers Ploughman to the abuse of the authority of the Church,
which rendered the credulous a prey to crafty itinerants. By Stat. 22 Heu. VIII. c. 12,
all proctors and pardoners travelling the country without sufficient authority were to
be treated as vagabonds. “ Pardonere, pardonnier.” PALSG.

2 To perform, as frequently used by the old writers, has the sense of to work, to
bring to completion. Caxton, in the Book for Travellers, says, ‘⁶ Donaas the doblet
maker hath performed my doublet, and my iaquet.¹' Amongst the ’ disbursements for
building Little Saxham Hall, 1507, given by Mr. Rokewode, in the Hist. os Thingoe
Hundred, Suffolk, p. 145, is a payment to “ Oliver mason for performing a dore.”
meorner or pmfournir signifies, according to Roquefort, aclzever, completer. “ Ι
performe (Lydgat) ie αοΙιίεαε, declared in I parforme.” PALSG.

³ This term is thus used in the later Wicliffite version, Eccl. xxii. ιΞΖ] z ‘⁴ As ournyng
(eber pargeting) ful of grauel in a cleer wal, so and a ferdful herte in be bou3t of a fool :
caementa sine imperis-d posita contra faciem venti non perma7zebunt,'' Vulg. In the
Accounts of Sir John Howard, A.D. 1467, is the following entry z ‘⁴ Item, the vj. day
of Aprylle my mastyr made a comenaunt wyth Saunsam the tylere, that he schalle
pel-gete, and whighte, and bemefelle all the new byldynge ς and he schal have fore his
labore xiij.s. iv.d.⁷‘ Househ. Exp. presented to the Roxburghe Club by B. Botfield,
Esq. p. 395. Amongst the charges for building Little Saxham Hall, A.D. 1506, are
payments “for lathing, pargetting, tiryng, and white casting all the roves, walles,
particyons‚ διο. for pargetments, and zelyng with mortre and herc.’' Rokewode's
Thingoe Hund. pp. 146, 148. Horman says, in the chapter cle re AEdzjficatorz'd, “ Some
men wyll haue theyr wallys plastred, some pergetted, and whytlymed; some roughe
caste, some pricked, some wrought with playster of Paris. Quidam parietes amant
loricatos, et tectorio vestitos ; quidam yypsum inducunt ; quidam albaria qrummulis
