work is called gadrooned, from the French '‘ yoderonmi, a fashion of imbossement used
by goldsmiths, and termed knurling.'' coTG. ροησε implies a wrinkle‚ crumple, or
gathen generally in allusion to dress, as in the V1 . of Piers Ploughman, 8657. “ Froun—
syng‚ froncement.” PALSG. Frontinella is not explained by Duc. and in the Ortus is
rendered ‘⁴ the pyt in the necke3 ” it seems, therefore, to mean a wrinkled or irregular
depression of surface. Possibly the correct reading may be froncinella. Froncz‘atus,
i. rayatus, Duc.

¹ “A fruntalle‚fi·ontale.'' cam. ANG. The frontal of an altar is defined by Lynd-
wood to be ‘¹ apparatus pendens in fronte altaris, qui apparatus alias dicitur Palca.”
Provinc. 252. The synod of Exeter, A.D. 1287, ordained that in every church the
parishioners should provide “frontellum ad quodlibet altare.” Wilkins, ii. 139. Abp.
lVinchelsey‚ in his Constitutione, A.D. 1305, prescribes that provision be made of “fron-
tale ad mafflzum altare, cum tribus tuellis.’' Lyndw. 252. The frontal must not be
confounded with the permanent decoration of the fore-part of the altar, properly tex-med
tabula or taMementum, which was formed either of sculptured or painted work, and
sometimes of the most precious metals, chased, enamelled, and set with geme, as was
that in Winchester cathedral‚ described in the Inventory given by Strype, Life of Abp.
Parker, App. 187. The frontal was formed of the most costly stuffs, and often, if not
properly by prescribed usage, was of the same suit or colour as the vestments used at
the same time in the service of the altar. As there were both the tabula frontalis and
supeofmatah's, which last seems to have been identical with the retro-tabula or post-
tabula, so likewise there were the pannus frontalis and superfrontalis, the second being
in both cases the decoration placed above the altar, and attached or appended to the
wall or screen against which it was placed. The inventory of sacred ornaments in
the VVardrobe Book of 29 Edw. Ι. Α.Ι). 1300, enumerates “Duo fivmalzkt ὒνοῖαῐαεα,
majora et wtzinora, de und seclc‘i,'’ p. 3505 identical, probably, in purpose with those
termed “frontella- ij pro altare, unum videlicet superius, et aliud *wlferius pro eodem,'’
which were purchased by John de Ombresley, Abbot of Evesham, from the executore
of Will. de Lynne, Bishop of Worcester, who died in 1373. Harl. MS. 3763. In Pat.
3 Hen. VI. these ornaments are again differently termed. Among various gifts to
churches in France delivered by the executore of Henry V. it appears that they sent to
St. Denis “unam altam frontellam, ec unam bassam frontellam de velvet, rubeas, cum
soliis aureis brouclerata3.'' Rym. x. 346. In the Inventory of the gifts of Abp. Chicheley
to All Souls' College, A.D. 1437, there appears to be a distinction between the terme
frontale and smniabam, as it enumerates, among many others, “j-frontale et suffwntale
de blodio velvet operatam cum stellis, patibulo, et salutatione ,· j frontellum de blodio
velvet cum soliis quercinis aaran vj frontys, et vj suffrontys unius sectae, steynid‚ pro
secundis altaribus? διο. Gutch, Coll. Cur. ii. 262. The precise difference is not
apparent; but each secta, or totus apparatus for an altar, comprised, according to this
document, the ‘⁸ frontale, suffmncale, frontellum, ij curtinoe, j des-eloth, j teca,” or
corporas case : possibly frontellnm may be only a diminutive of the other term. Ducange
gives the term “refrontaZe, apparatus altaris‚” the same, probably, as the pannus
supeffroutalis; as likewise the tabula svpraf‘ronlalis was, as has been observed, termed
also retro-tabula.
