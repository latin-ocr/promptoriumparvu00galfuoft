² Jamieson observes that deas signifies properly stupid, and the term is transferred in
a more limited sense to the ear. It is also applied to that which has lost its germinating
power ι thus in the North, as in Devonshire, a rotten nut is called deaf, and barren corn
is called deas corn, an expression litei-ally AngaeSaX. An unproduetive soil is likeuise
termed deaf. The plant lamium, or archangel, known by the common names dead or
blind nettle, in the Promptorium, has the epithet DEFFE, evidently because it does not
possess the stinging property of the true nettle.

ANG. The (laia 15 mentioned in Domesdzq, among assistants in husbandry, and the
Qd Stat. 25 dev. 111„ A.D. 1351, occasioned by the exorbitant demand for wages made
by servants after the pestilence‚ enacts that ‘⁵ chen-2172 ckartctter, comer, ckaceom’ des
carues, bercher, porcher, (leffe et tous autres „certante” should he content with such
rate of wages as had been previously usual, and serve not by the day, but the year, or
other usual term. The term is again found in Stat. 3? Edw. 111.‚A.D.1363‚ c. 14,
“ cle ricta ct z·‹³stz'tu,'’ which defines the homely provision and attire suitable to the estate

drivers of geese. The Stat. 12 Rich. ΙΙ. c. 4, A.D. 1388, ffixes the wages of all servants
for husbandry, and rates the porche& femme laborer, and (lest at vjs. each by the year.
The word is here translated ‘⁶ deye '³ and “ (leyrie woman.’' In the Stat. 23 Hen. VI.
c. 13, hy which the wages of such servants were assessed at double the previous rate,
the term (leffe is no longer used. It appears by Fleta, 1. 11. e. 87, de vascam-tce, that the
andros-lein was a female servant who had the charge of all that pertained to the ‘⁴ dtz'e'ria,''
and of making cheese and butter. A more detaiied account of her duties is given by Alex.
