penter's plumb-line, “ riylet,'' and the mariner's lead, “plomb de sonde.” The
plummet was used in ancient times as an instrument of tortum, and also as a weapon.
It is said in the Golden Legend that “ the Provost of Rome dyde so bete St. Urban wt
plummettes.'’ Horman remarks that “ Champyons smyte at eche other with plum-

met3 of leed sowed in leather.'’
¹ “ Plonkete,'’ or in another MS. ‘⁴ blunket,” occurs in the Awntyrs of Arthure, and

is explained by Sir F. Madden as signifying a white stuff.
“ Η11· belte was of plonkete, withe birdis fulle baulde.’'

In Mr. Robson's edition ‘⁴ blenket‚'⁷ st. xxix. ; possibly the white stuff called in French
blanc-het. “ Ploncket colour, blev.’⁷ PALSG. “ Caesius, graye of colour, or blunkette.
Scyricum, blonket colour, or light wachet. Venetus, lyght blewe, or blunket.’‘ ELYOT.
“ Conleurpers, skie colour, a blunket or light blue.” COTG. The old Gloss on Spenser's
Sheph. Cal. May, explains it as signifying grey. See Nares, and Jamieson, v. Bloneat.

2 The poyntel, formed of metal‚ or other hard material, was used like the Roman
stilus for writing upon portable tablets, or writing-tables. It appears in the well-
known portraits of Chaucer, and is appended by a little lace to the lowest of three
buttons which serve to close the fent of the collar of his gown at the throat. Copies
of this interesting portrait are found in Roy. MS. 17, D. vn, f. 90, v⁰: Harl. MS.
4866, f. 883 Lansd. MS. 851, and Add. MS. 5141. The last has been taken as the
subject of a plate in Shaw’s Dresses and Decorations. Chaucer describes the Limitour
in his progress, who preached and begged alms as he went, whilst his attendant was
furnished with

“ A pair of tables all of ivory,
And a pointel ypolished fetisly,
And wrote alway the names, as he stood,
Of alle folk that yave hem any good.’⁷ Sompn. Tale, v. 7324.

A beautiful ivory pointel, of the workmanship of the earlier part of the fourteenth cen-
tury, formerly in the Du Sommerard Collection, is preserved in the Musee des Thermes,
at Paris. It is stated in the Golden Legend that ‘⁸ a grefe (or greffe) is properly called
a pointell to wryte in tables of waxe.” St. Felix was killed by his scholar-s therewith.
Hel-man, in his chapter on writing, mentions the various materials of which pointels
were formed: ⁴‘ Poyntillis of yron, and of siluer‚ bras, boone, or stoone‚ hauynge a
pynne at the ende, be put in theyr case (97·aphiario.)‘' ‘⁴ Poyntell or caracte, esplinyue
defer.'' PALSG. Bishop Kennett‚ in 1115 Glossarial Collections, gives “ Poitrel, a stile
or writing instrument, with one end sharp, and the other broadst Lansd. MS. 1033.
