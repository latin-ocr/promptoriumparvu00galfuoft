Churche, for ryngyng the clocher bells.” sslomf. Hist. ii. 155.

¹ “ A clotte, cespis, occarimn. To clotte, occare. A clottynge malle, occatorimn.”
cArH. ANG. ‘⁴ Occo, ylcbasfinnyere, to clotte.” ORTUS. In the Medulla, Harl. MS. 2257,
occur 6ἢφῖεὒιινίαε, a elotte maller. Gleba esc durus cespes cam Ιιενῦἂ, an harde klotte.''
Palsgrave gives the verb to clodde as signifying the formation, and not the breaking up of
elods. “To clodde, go in to heapes. or in to pcces, as the yerthe dothe, amonceler.
This yerthe clotteth so faste that it must be broken. To clodde‚ fifflr, j'ortz'er, conyeler.’'

2 A note, copied by Hearne from a copy of the Promptorfflm, states that the eompiler
of the work was ‘⁵ frater Ricccrdzcs Fraunces, inter quatuor parietes pro Cho-isto 171zclasus.''
See Hearne's Glossary to Langtoft’s Chron. under the word Nesshe. Π, however⁷ it had
been true that he had belonged to the order of Anchorites, who were called inclusi,
or reclusi, it seems probable that some indication of the fact would have herc occurred.
The dwelling of the Anchorite‚ domus inclusi, or clusoriam, appears to have often
immediately adjoined the church‚ and is doubtless in many instanees still to be dis-
tinguished. The ritual for his benediction will be found in Martnne, Antiq. Rit. lib. iii.
0. 3. Palsgrave gives the verb “to close up in a wall, or bytwene walles, emmzcrcr.
Cannest thou fynde in thy herte to be an Anker, to be closed up in a wall ?'' See here-
after RECLUSE.

³ Compare CLAUSURE‚ or 0105. J amieson gives closeris, enclosules, and eloserris, which
llo conjectures may signify clasps. In Norfolk Forby observes that the cover of a book is
called clodger, which he supposes to be derived from the Frcnch, οἴω-ίαν, as the term
codger is corrupted from cosia, a cobler.
