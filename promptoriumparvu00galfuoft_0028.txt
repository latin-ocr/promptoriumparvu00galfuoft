XX PREFACE.

tus ’) in more disparaging terms than he applies to himself. ‘ Rudis et
inscius, plusque aptus discere quam docere,' he contents himself for the
most part with abbreviating the works of earlier grammarians, occasionally
seeking counsel from the mouth of his betters‚ but very rarely venturing
to pronounce sentence in his own proper person. He arranges the English
words in alphabetical order, first placing under every letter the nouns and
other parts of speech except verbs, and then the verbs by themselves.’‘
The title of the work denoted its use; from its brevity it would be readily
procured and consulted by all parvuli or clerici. Mr. Mayor proceeds as
follows: “The preface ends in a strain which was natural to scholars who,
having seldom any means of procuring books except by transcribing them
with their own hand, and being at the mercy of any scribe who might
wittingly or unwittingly travesty their most careful works, learnt to detest
a blunder as worse than a crime: ‘1 humbly with prayers entreat all
pedagogues‚ teachers, and masters, that when they have examined this
little work, they will approve what may by God's assistance have been
rightly written, and will piously correct and emend what is written ill or
erringly; since humble grammarians and boys may look on this short
volume as on a mirror, and find freely and immediately the common words
which belong to the Latin tongue.’ ”²²

Fortunate indeed had it been if the original conscientiously elaborated
by Geoffrey’s own hand had been preserved to our times. We should
not have been exposed to manifold perplexities occasioned by vitia-
tions of the text through the heedlessness of transcribers. In offering to
students of our old language and literature the results of minute colla-
tion of all the known MSS. of his work, by which many corruptions of
the text may be amended, I can only renew the simple appeal of the
author, ιι111, 011111 exile hoc opus perspexerint, quod Deo me juvante sit
recte scriptum approbent, et quod male aut devie pie corrigant et
emendenff’

Scarcely inferior in interest to the Promptorium‚ as an aid to the
student of fifteenth-century language and literature, is the Latin-English
dictionary‚ the first work of that description, entitled Medulla Grammatice
