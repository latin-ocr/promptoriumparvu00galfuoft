Ortus in 1514, described p. lix. supm, we find these authorities combined

to which no allusion is made in the earlier editions. Jodocus Ascensius,
father-in-law of the eminent scholar and lexicographer Robert Stephens,
was a writer of considerable note at the period of the rcvival of learning.
It may not easily be ascertained from which of his treatises these papulam}

antiquities. It will be seen, however, from the foregoing observations that
in the preparation of the Ortus, the earliest work of its class printed in
Enghmd, the most erudite authorities available at the period had been
consulted.

The following enumeration of editions of the Ortus Vocabulorum may
bc acceptable 111 default of accurate notices of the work by bibliographical
writers.

⁸ An account of the literary labors of Ascensius is given by Maittaire, Vit. Stepham

norum, pp. 17, 109. His treatises ‘⁶ De Epistolis'' and ‘¹ De orthographia Latinorum
dictionum ’' were included in a collection published in 1501, to which he prefixed a pre-

face ‘⁶ ex officina nostra litteraria in Parrhis. Lutetia.’' Another of his works, the ‘⁶ Voca-
bulorum Interpretatio‚'' may be found in the Opus Grammaticum of Sulpitius Verulanus,
printed by Pynson⁷ 1505, and stated to be ‘⁶ cum textu Ascensiano recognito et auct0.”
