¹ “Asadzela, Iordeyne or pisse-potte,” MED. ‘⁶ A Iordane, madida, madellum, minsa-
rc'um.’' cun. ANG. Walsingham relates the appropriate punishment imposed upon a
quack physician, who was compelled to ride through London with his face to the horsc's
tail, his neck garnished with claae ollce, quas Iordanes vulyo voca77zzcs.'' A.D. 1382, ed.
Camd. 238. Holinshed, who calls him ‘² a coleprophet,'⁷ terms them “ two iorden pots.”
Chron. iii. p. 440. Chaucer speaks of uri-ials and “jordanes ’³ (Pardonere’s Proh),
and if not identical, they seem to have been similar in form. See the marginal sketch
in Sloane's MS. 73, f. 138, b. where it is said, in the directions for preparing vermillion,
“ take a. good thicke Iordau of glas‚'' which, after being well covered with luting‚ was to
be used as a sort of crucible. It is precisely of the same shape as the glass vessel usually
held by the leech, or water-doctor, in ancient representations. The word is found in the
Vision of Ρ. Ploughman‚ and is used by Shakespeare. Skinner thinks it is not derived
from the name of the river Jordan, but from Angr-Sax. gor, sordes, and den. recepta-
culum ,· an etymology which has been adopted hythe author of the Craven Glossary.
The derivation from Armoric, dourdeu, urina, has also been suggested. Blount states
that the jordan was a double urinal, but offers no explanation.

² The Jewish community being regarded as the property of the Sovereign, is termed
in ancient records ‘⁶ ,Iudaismus Refjis, Jmlaismus noster, or commmeitas Judceommn nos-
tr0rum;'’ and the Jews were bound to reside only in royal cities and boroughs. See
“ Les Escatucz (le Za, Je2!eo·z'e,‘' t. Edw. Ι. Stat. of Realm, i. 221. They were marked by
a badge, and, although it does not appear that they were compelled to dwell in one part
of a city appropriated to them, as is the Glcetlo in the cities of Italy, yet they seem to
have congregated in a district, probably on account of the detestation in which they were
held, and it is remarkable that, although more than five centuries have elapsed since they
were totally expelled by Edw. I. in 1290, the memorial of their settlement in many cities
in England is still preserved in the local name of Jewry. M. Paris speaks of the
Jzulaisnms at lVorcester, which was ravaged by Rob. <le Ferrars in 1264 ; and Rob. of
Glouc. says of the great outrage at the accession of Richard Coeur de Lion,

‘⁴ Ther was many a wild hine, that prest was ther to,
And wcnde in to the Gywerie‚ and woundede, and to drowe‚’⁷ δίο. p. 485.

R. Brunne uses “ Juerie” in a like signification. See Chaucer's account of the ‘⁶ Jewerie”
in a Christian city in Asia 3 Prior. T. 13‚419. Besides the Old Jewry in the metropolis,
there is still the Jewry at Canterbury. Leland speaks of the street at winchester, leading
fron] the High Street to the North Gate, ‘⁶ caullyd the Jury, by cause Jues did enhahite
it, and had theyr synagoge than-02⁹ [tin. iii. f. 71. and says of Warwick, “ The suburbe
without the East Gate is called the Smithes streete ; I hard ther thatthe Jues some tyme
dwellyd in it.'' Itin. iv. f. 165, a. In ancient deeds relating to Warwick “the Jurye”
is mentioned, and the Jury street still exists. At Lynn, where the Promptorium was
compssed, the Jews had formed a numerous settlcment at an early period, and there is
still the Jews' street. Bloinf. Norf. iv. 578. In low Latin the part of a city reserved for
the Jews was called ,ladrum-ici, Jmleria, Jectoerirae„ οι· «Ῑειιίωιι, in French daim-le, ‹lah-ic,
or Jacerie ‚⁴ wherein, iu some countries, they werc compelled exclusively to dwell, Sce

and Caley's Observations, Archaeol. viii. 389.
