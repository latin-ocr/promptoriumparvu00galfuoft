respecting preparations for the expedition into France, “ γε Kyng sendythe ordynaunce

sion was made by the gentry, who were to accompany him, “ for hors harnes, tentes, halys,

of Northumberland, in the French campaign 111 1513, at the siege of Therouenne, are
named “ hay-Hes, tents, and pauillions.''‘ Ant. Rep. iv. 364. See also Hall’s Chron.

MS. 1033, and Grose mention another 113016 for 1116 same measure, in use 111 1116 North,
namely, ‘⁶ frundele, 3 measure of two peehs.'' As it is called entyndele, because it is the
eighth part of a coom, so also furundel, or frundele, a corruption of furthindele, as being
the fourth part of 3 bushel. Ang.-Sax. 16018311, quartus, See Cowel’s Interpr. τ. Furem-
dsllns. The term ‘⁶ eytendele '' occurs in the Hist. Eliensis, where it is recorded of Will.

“ I would kick him for half a fartliing;“' but the cue seems to have been as imaginary as
the bodle, of like supposed value, aud in the North familiarly mentioned as if it really
existed. See Brockett, and the other North-country glossar-ists.
