¹ Laking, signifying a child's toy, is a word still used in the North, as Brockett
observes. In the Towneley Mysteries‚ Mak tells the shepherds that his wife brings him
every year “a lakan,'' and some years twms. The verb to layke, Ang.-Sax. Iacan,
ludeo-e, and the substantive layke, disport, occur frequently in the old writers. See Sir F.
Madden's Glossaries to william and the lVerwolf, and Gawayn 3 Seuyn Sages, &3103
Min0t‚ p. 10 ; Vision of P. Ploughm. 11110 341 ; Towneley Myst. pp. 96, 102, 141. The
local use of the verb is noticed in the Cheshire and Craven Glossaries, as likewise by
Brockett. Skinner remarks that it is commonly heard throughout the North, a circum-
stance which he is disposed to attribute to the Danish occupation. Dan. leeger, ludo.
Bp. Kennett gives “ Leikin, a sweet-heart‚ Northumb. ab Aug-sax. lician, placere.”
Lansd. MS. 1033.

² The Gloss on G. de Bibelcsworth gives “terre freche, leylond ;” 111 the MS. in Sir
Thes. Phillipps’s collection, “ ley3e.’' “ Rus, a leylonde. Ruricola, a tyleare of leylonde.''
man. MS. CANT. ⁸⁴ Selio, a lec lande.” omns. “Novak, falowe. Senio, Aozylz‘ce leye.”
HARL. MS. 1002, f. 148. “A leylande‚ salio, frisca terra. Ley, iscalmus, z'squalz'dus.”
caru. ANG. “ Iscolidus', a felde u11tylde.” MED. “ Lay lande, terre novztellement ἰιιόοννέ0.”
PALSG. “Rudetum‚ lande which hath leyen leye, and is newly put in tylthe.’' ELYOT.
In the poem entitled the Hunttyng of the Hare, it is related how the hare escaped, “ and
feyr toke up a falow ley‚’' no more to be seen by her pursuers. Ed. lVebcr, 152. Lay-
land, according to Bailey, is fallow or unploughed land, and there are many places which
have thence derived the name. Ang.-Sax. ley, terra inculta, novale. Forby observes
that in central Suffolk a coarsc old pasture is calleda lay. Compare SOMYR laylond.
Novale.

³ Compare DYSPREYSYN’‚ or laekysi'. “ Vituperium, blame or lacke.” ORT. To lakk,
depravare, ὥς. ubi to blame.'' CATH. ANG. In the Vision of P. Ploughman, Envy says
that when his neighbour met with a customer, whilst he sold nothing, he was ever ready

“ To lye and to loure on my neghebore,
And to lakke his ehaffare.” 2736.

Chaucer uses the word precisely in the same sense, 111 Romance of the Rose. Fabyan‚ in
“ Lenuoy '⁹ of his viith part, excuses himself as unable to adapt his Chronicle to the liking
of every temler,

‘⁶ And spccyally to suche as haue theyr delyghtynge
Euer wyth dysclaunder moste wryters to lacke,
And barke whyle they maye, to sette good wryters a backe.''

“ 1 lacke a thynge, I fynde faute at it, Ie trouue ὰ redire. Ι lacke, I wante a thynge, I 'ay
saulce. I lacke a penne.'’ PALSG. Compare Dutch laecken, minuere, deterere. Lydgate
uses the substantive lack in the sense of dispraise. See his poem to put in remembrancc
of virtue and vice, of the diligent and the indolent. (Minor Poems, p. 84.)

“ Of whichc the reporto of both is thus reserved,
With lawde‚ or lack, 110110 as they haue desc1·vcd.’⁷
