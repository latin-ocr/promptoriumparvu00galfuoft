PREFACE. xlvii

a ii. to n iii. On the title f. 1, “ Promptorium paruulorum cleri001·um‚” &c
as in W. de Worde’s edition before described, a woodcut is introduced
pertraying the author seated at a desk. On the reverse is the prologue⁷
‘⁴ Ce1·nentibus‚'' Sco. On f. 2 commence the “ Nomina A.——Incipit liber qui
dicitur Promptorium paruulorum sive cleric(›rum.” At the end is the
colophon, “Ad tandem, &a Impressum per egregium Julianum nota—
rium Impressorem commorantem extra temple barre sub Intersignio Sanc-
torum trium regum, Sec. Anno domini millesimo CCCCCOctauo xii.
die Augusti.” On the reverse is a woodcut measuring&¹ inches by 3 inches,
being the device of the printer, a trec to which is appended a helm and an
escutcheon charged with Julian‘s mark and initials. Around the tree are
animals, birds, a butterfly, &052 .

A few various readings obtained from the editions by XVynkyn dc
Worde and Julian Notary are indicated in the present work by the
initials (W) and (J) respectively.

Ι have now described, with minuteness of detail which, I sear, some
may regard as tedious‚ all the MSS. and printed texts of the Promp—
torium known to me 3 and these have been collated in the preparation
of the present edition. On a former occasion I stated the grounds ot'
preference which influenced nie in selecting the Harleian MS. 221 as
the groundwork and text of the present edit-ion, and I pointed out that
all additions are distinguished from the text by being placed within
brackets with the authority for their introduction‚ each word or various
reading being followed by an initial indicating the source whence it is
derived.

The contractions have been printed in extenso, with a few exceptions
where any doubt could arise3 thus the letter h is found with the trans-
verse stroke usually indicating an e, but accompanied also by that letter, as

¹² Biblioth. Grenv. p. 576; Dibdiu‚ Typ. Antiq. vol. ii. p. 585. Herbert quotes it siae
anno, which seems to show that he had never seen it. I may here recall, among many kind-
nesses of a highly-valued friend, the Rev. S. R. Maitland, the communication of his dis-
covery, in 1843, of four leaves in a volume in the Lambeth library, used as fly-leaves,
and which Ι identified as fragments of the rare edition by Julian Notary. They are
sign. b iii. and n ii. This fragment is noticed by Dr. Maitland in his List of some of the
early printed books in the Archiepiscopal Library‚ 1843, p. 464, and in an Index of such
English books printed before 1600 as are in that collection, 1345, p. 120.
