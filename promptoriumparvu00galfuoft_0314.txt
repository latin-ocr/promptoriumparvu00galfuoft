¹ An engrafted scion is called in Norfolk a greft, or grift, according to Forby, who
proposes as an etymon Ang.-Sax. graeft, sculptile. “Grafiffi or gryfi'e of a tree, eme.

² This fabulous animal is particularly described by Sir John Maundevile, 111 his account
of Bacharie. ‘⁶ In that contree ben many griffounes, more pleutee 111311 111 ony other
contree. Sum men seyn that thei han the body upward as an engle, and benethe as 3
lyoune, and treuly thei seyn sothe that thei ben of that schapp. But o griffoun hathe the
bod) more gret, and is more strong thanne viij. lyouns, of suche lyouns as ben o this half,
and more gret and strongere than an 0. egles, suche as we han amonges us.'' He further
states that agriffin would bear to its nest a horse, or a couple of oxen yoked to the plough3
its talons being like horus of great oxen, and serving as drinking-eups3 and of 1110 ribs
and wing feathers strong bows were made. See p. 325. Casle)¹ observes that in the
Cotton Library there was such a cup, 4 ft. in length, silver-hooped, and inscribed ‘⁶ Griplzi
‘cueym's (ἶίτο Οῑιθιῖιένῖο Dzmclmcasi sacer ,- ” another 0111101151)- mounted as a standing cup,
on an eagle's leg of silver, is still preserved in the cabinet of antiquities at Paris, in the
King's Lim-ary, having been brought, at the Revolution, whh the spoils of the treasury
of St. Denis. A eurious account of it is given by Doublet, in his history of that abbey,
p. 343. From an ancient ms. 11110111. of the 11035111)ν of Bayeux Cathedral, it appears
that three such talons were there preserved, and on solemn occasions appended to the
altar, as precious rarities. A “ corne de gli-effoeta ’¹ is mentioned in the Kalend. of Exch.
iii. 176. The egg was likcwise preserved as a valuable curiosity, and used 35 3 goblet;
see the lists of the jewels and plate of Edw. III. 1338, ibid. pp. 171, 172. “ Icem,j
oflee ¹qriffon yurnz's d’fflyfnt, od pie εί cocercle.’' The griffiu was assumed hythe Le
Despenser family, and the upper part appears as the erest 011 the helm of Hugh le
Despenser, who died 1349, exhibited 011 1115 1011111 at Tewkesbury. Another strikingly
designed representation of this curious animal is seen at lVarwick‚ at the feet of Richard
Beauchamp, who died 1439.

³ R. Brunne uses this word in the sense of stern, or cruel. He says of Rufus,

“ To riche meu was he grille, of pouer held no tales.” Langton, chron. p. 92.

It is thus used by Chaueer. See also Amis and Amiloun, 1275, 1802; Towneley Myst.
