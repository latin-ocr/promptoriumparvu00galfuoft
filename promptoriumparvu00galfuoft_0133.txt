The functions of the third extended to the expulsion of evil spirits by the imposition of
hands upon persons possessed, recently baptized, and catechumens. The ceremony was

always aceompanied with aspersion, and the name benett was doubtless taken from the
aqua benedicta, ectu benite, or, perhaps, from the vessel called in Freneh Minister, which
contained the hely-water. In a will dated 1449 is a bequest of “a gret holy-water
scoppe of silver, with a staff benature, the sayd benature and staff weying xx nobles in
plate.'' The staff benature was the aspersorium, termed in the Promptorium STRENKYL,
halywater styc. Fox, relating the death of Hooper, states that it was part of the cere-
mony of degrading Bishops to ‘⁶ take from them the lowest vesture which they had in
taking bennet and collet’' (i. e. acolyte). Eecles. Hist. iii. 152, A.D. 1555. Τ. Beeon,
in the Reliques of Rome, says, ‘⁴ Bonifaee V. decreed that such as were but benet and
colet should not touch the reliques of saints, but they only which are subdeacons, deaeom,
and priests.” Edit. 1563, f. 183.

¹ This appears to be the wood-bine, which in Swedish is called beeszwed. Linn. Flor.
Suec. Verelius explains the Icelandic beinwid to be ossea pericliminz's species, a bony
kind of honeysuekle, beinwicl signifying bone-wood. Ivy is in the North called bind-
wood. See Jamieson.

² See BYxGGEn and BYNGE, theca, camera, A.S. bin. In Norfolk and Suffolk still
pronounced bing. as in Danish, bing, cumulus. FORBY.

² This is one of the number of words in which the A.S. Mael, pars, occurs in com-
position. The A.S. form of these adverbs is madum, in parts, bitmnaelum, dael-maelum,
διο. We have retained piecemeal, but the rest are wholly obsolete. See in Nares,
drop-meal‚ inch·meal‚ and limb—meal. P. Ploughman uses pounde-mele and percel-
mele. In the Liber Festivalis we read that William Tracy, after the murder of St.
Thomas of Canterbury, “ fylle syke and roted all his body, in somoehe that himselfe
with his owne hondes cast away his owne flesshe lompe-mele.'’ Palsgrave gives “by
ynehe-meale, menuement, par poulcees, and flock-meale, par trou22ectux.''

‘⁶ Only that point his peple bare so sore
That flockmel on a day to him they went.'' CHAUC. Clerke’s T.
