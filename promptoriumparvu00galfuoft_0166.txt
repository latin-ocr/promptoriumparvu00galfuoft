¹ “ caldarium, a cawdell.” our. voc. Palsgrave renders it chaudeau, which, according
to Roquefort, was “ bouillon qzc'ou donnons ava: efpozcx le malin (lu lendenaria (les noces,
calens jasculum.” In Caxton’s Boke for Travellers occur as “PotageS. Caudell for
the seke, clzazcclel. Growell and wortes.” Skinner and Junius interpret it to be merely
a spiey drink ; but in the ancient 1011115 of cookery cawdel signifies generally anything
stewed down to a pure‘e ,· see in the Forme of Cury, pp. 24, 27, ‘⁴ Chykens in cawdel,
cawdell ferry ;'¹ and in Cott. MS. Julius, D. vni. f. 100, “ Caudelle of samone, caudelle
of muskles.’' See further, calenum, in Charpentier.

² Cawcewey is derived directly from the French clzavsseffe, a word taken, as Menage
an‹l other writers have observed, from the Latin calciata, so called, as some conjecture,
from 115 being continually trodden, via calcata, but probably rather from the mode of
forming 511011 a road, with stones imbedded in mortar. via calceata, from calx, lime. See
Spelnian, Duc-ange, and Kennet, under the word calcea. There was a causeway at Lynn
leading to Gaywood, 011 which was situated the Hospita] of St. Mary Magdalen‚ and
among the benefactors to the Hospital of St. John Baptist occurs Ufketel filius sancti-
monialis de Scerz'nyes‚ who grants ‘⁶ totam terram in Limne super calcetam.” Mon. Ang.
vi. 648, new edit. Palsgrave gives ⁴⁶ Causey in a hye way, chause‘e.''

³ Cotgrave renders ‘⁶ cantelle, a wile, cautell, sleight, guilefull devise, subtilty.'’
Fabyan relates that, in 1448, the town of Pont-de-l'arche was taken by the ‘⁸ cautele''
of the Frenchmen, who introduced two men disguised as carpentem ; and Han, speaking
of the same occurrence, calls it ‘⁶ a praty cautele and slighte imposture.'‘ In Elyot’s
Lilsrarie occurs ‘⁴ Qffacios, cawtelles‚ crafty wayes to deceyue.'’

⁵ In Norl'olk the basket carried by the sower is still called a seed-lep. FORBY. A. Sax.
saed-leap, seminatoris cml-bis. See hereafter noPUR, and SEEDLEP.

plains segs to be the water flower-de luce. “ Glayeul (le νίυῖὲνε, sedge, water flags.'' COTGR.

7 'she name sedge is now applied indiscriminately to the genus carex, which, probably
from the stiffness 05· its grou-th, was called also stare. In Su. G. it is denominated starr,
