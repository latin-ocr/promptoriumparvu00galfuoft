² Selden remarks that acquaintance with the Latin tongue was considered such an
attainment that Latinista„ habentor, or Latium-ivs, became significant of an interpreter in
general. Hugo Latium-ius is mentioned in Domesday. Latinier, as Roquefort explains
it, signified commonly an interpreter, trachemeat, or dragoman. He cites the Roman (le
Gamla, where mention occurs of a Latinier¹ whose attainments extended to speaking
‘⁴ Roman, azymis, GaHois, et Breton, et Normamss' Sir John Maundevile, speaking of
the routes to the Holy Land, says of the one by way of Babylon, “ And alle weys fynden

³ Latten, a hard mixed metal much resembling brass, was largely used in former times,
especially in the formation of sepulchral memoriale. The precise nature of its composition
does not appear to have been accurately ascertained. Itis repeatedly mentioned as a
metal of a bright and golden eolour ; Chaucer uses the comparison that Phoebus “ hewed
like latoun.'' Gower speaks of it as distinct from brass, as it seems properly to have been,
although occasionally confounded therewith‚ and even with copper. ‘⁶ Aaricalcum, i. sex
auri, laten or coper.'' ORTUS. ‘⁶ Auovlcalcum, Anylice goldesome 3 Electrv'num, latyne.'’
Harl. MS. 1002, f. 149. “ Latyn metall, latn.'' PALSG. Latten was probably obtained
from Germany. In the covenants for the workmanship of the effigy of Richard Beau-
ehamp, 1454, by Thos. Stevyns, copper-smith of London‚ the metal is described as
‘⁴ latten‚” or ‘⁴ Cullen plate,'' (Cologne Ρ) the value of which was lod. a pound. The
remote derivation of the word is very obscure : it was probably adopted in England from
the German Letton, or French [αι’ίοη. Compare Dutch lattoen‚ Isl. laatun, Ital. octone,
lattone, Span. (ιῖατοη, laton. Plate tin had also the appellation latten. Sec Forby and
