XXX PREFACE.

Anglia quo fulget, quo gaudent presule clam
Londonie, quo parisius scrutante sophiam
Florebat studium, basis aurea fulgide fulco,
Firme justicie misteria suscipe sacre,

Cuncte studio distincta metroque Johannis.

In the margin is written ; “ Domino F. episcopo London. Magister J,
de Karlandia (sic) seipsum et opus suum de misteriis ecclesie.'⁷ There
are interlinear glosses as well as marginal comments by a later hand3 over
basis aurea in the third line is to be read “alludit nomini suo‚” namely
Basset. This work is a mystical explanation iu hexameter verse of rites of the
church, vcstments and appliances of sacred use, διο. The difference of opi-
nion among writers on mediaeval literature, as regards the time when John de
Garlandia lived and the country of which he was a native, has been already
noticed. The assertion of Pits, that he was born in England, has been fol-
lowed by Fabricius, Moreri, and Du Cange3 and, although the dedication of
the poem which Ι have here noticed is doubtless insufficient evidence to prove
that the friend ofa bishop of London was himself an Englislnnan, yet it
may suffice to show that the author was contemporary with a distinguished
prelate of that see named Fuike, and none so named is found earlier than
Fulke Basset, who was elected in 1241, and died in 12595ι It would thus
appear that John de Garlandia lived in the thirteenth century, which the
evidence previously noticed tends also to prove, and not in the carly part
of the eleventh century, as stated by the Benedictines in the Histoire
Litteraire de la France.

ὅ. Merarius—In a volume of grammatica] tracts mostly attributed
to J ohannes de Garlandia, preserved in the Library at Caius College,
Cambridge, as already noticed, I find appended to the “ Dz‘ccionarius

noticed. catalogue of MSS. in Caius College Library, by the Rev. J. J. Smith, p. 179.
A copy among Archbishop Parker’s MSS. C.C.C. Cant. is described by Nasmyth, “ Carmen
ad Fulconem Episcopum Londoniensem de Ritibus EcclesiasticiS.”—-MS. CL. No. 4.

⁸ M. Geraud, Paris sous Philippe le Bel, Append. p. 583, adverts to this poem by John
de Garlandia, but he observes that it is not known who the bishop in question was, his
name being indicated only by the initial F. He is, however, identified by the gloss in
the MS. above described. The argument that the author was born in France, because
the name de Garlanffia, possibly from a place so called in Brie, is French rather than

English, does not prove that he was not a native of this country, or of a family established
in England.
