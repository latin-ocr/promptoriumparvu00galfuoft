Pilleum, according to the Catholicon, signifies a garment made of skins, but, in its more
usual sense, a covering for the head. In early times the cappa was an ordinary upper
garment worn by ecclesiastics indiscriminately, and Ecgbert, Abp‚ of York, ordained
in the VIIIth century that none of the clergy should appear in the church “ sine colobio
vel cappd.” Of the various modifications of this vestunent, and the names by which
they were distinguished, a detailed account will be found in Dueange. At a later period
the eope was a vestnient reserved for occasions of ceremony : when worn hy prelates and
dignitariae, the richest tissues were chosen, and covered with a gorg-eous display of
jewels, orfrays, and embroidery; but its use was not confined to them, for, with the
exception of the priest officiating at the altar, who was vested in the sacred garinents
appropriated to the service of the 111833, the eope appears to have been worn by all tlte
assisting clergy, and even the choristers. In A. Sax. the name cappa,¹ or caeppa, was
adopted from the Latin, probably as early as the mission of St. Augustine‚ A.D. 601;
and a cappa oloserica, one of the gifts of Gregory the Great, was preserved at Canterbury
until the Reformation. See hereat'ter COOPE‚ capa.

¹ The use of a small cap by the clergy as a eovering of the tonsure is one of con-
siderable antiquity; it was usually termed the coif, coyplza, and this term occurs hereafter
in the Promptorium. This was identical, as Joh. de Athona asserts, with the leuce or
insaloe ‚· but these appear more properly to have been lappets appended to the coit, ansl
which occasionally were fastened under the chin. At various periods, when the clergy,
disregarding strict propriety in demeanour and dress, became assimilated in externals to
the laity‚ the coif was specially decried by the Church. Thus, in the Council of London
in 1267, the Legate Othobonus ordained that the elergy should never appear in public
with the coif, except in travelling, because thereby the corona, or circlet of hair left by
the tonsure, was coneealed, and therein “praecipue depositio terrenorum, et reqalis
sacerdotii difflzitas cleszyawetarst' See Lynwode, Provinciale, p. 88⁷ Hure, howe, or
howfe, are synonymous, and are derived from A. sax. hufa‚ cidaris. See hereafter

³ This word, which. as Skinner observes, is evidently a corruption of caballas, is used

by Chaucer: the Cambridge Seholar exclaims, when the Miller lets his horse loose,
“ Why ne hadst thou put the capell in the lathe.'’ Reve's Tale.

¹⁴ Capull‚ a horse, roussin.” PALSG. cotgrave explains rous-sin to be “a curtall, a
strong German horse.” Elyot gives “ caballus, a horse ; yet in some partes of England
