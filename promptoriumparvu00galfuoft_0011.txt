IN producing this first portion of the Promptorium‚ the
Editor, having for various reasons been induced to with-
hold for the present his inore detailed Preface, feels it
requisite to offer a few preliminary observations. The
present edition is formed upon the text of thc Harleian
MS. 221, which has been selected as the most ancient,
the most correct, and the most copious of the MSS. of
which the existence has hitherto been ascertained. The
additions that have been made from other MSS„ and
from Pynson’s edition, are numerous ; these, as likewise
the corrections and various readings, are distinguished
from the text by being placed within brackets, With the
indication of the sources whence they are severally de-
rived. In a few instances, where the reading of the
Harl. MS. appeared so faulty as to justify an alteration
of the text, the rej ected word has been given in the notes ;
but more frequently it has been considered preferable to
leave the reading of the MS. unaltered‚ and to give the
various reading, which at once suggests the correction.
