¹ “To bryse, quatere, quarsare. Brysille‚ fiayilis, fisilz's, fracticius, fractillis.”
CATH. ANGL. A.S. brysan‚ conterere. The word bryse is, however, probably taken
more directly from the Freneh. Palsgrave gives “to brise or bray herbes or suche
like in a mortar, briser.'' In the curious treatise of the virtues of herbs, Roy. MS.
18 A. VI. f. 72 b. is mentioned ‘⁶ brysewort, or bomwort, or daysye, consolida minor,
good to breke bocches.''

² Elyot renders “Amrlecstz, fragmentes of meate whiehe fall vnder the table. Ana-
lectes, he that gadereth vp brokelettes.”

³ The broche was an ornament common to both sexes; of the largesse of Queen
Guenever it is related, “Everych kny3t she 3af broche other ryng.'' LAUNFAL MILES-
“ Fibula, a boton, or broche, prykke, or a pynne, or a lace. Manae, ornamentum est
quod solet ex feminarum pendere collo, quod alio nomine dicitur firmaculum, a broche.”
ORT. voc. The jewel which it was usual about the commenceinent of the XVIth Cen-
tury to wear in the cap was called a broche. Palsgrave gives ‘⁸ Broche for ones cappe,
broche, ymaye, amidae, afficqaet. Make this brotche fast in your cappe. Broche with
ascripture, denise.” The beautiful designs of Holbein executed for Henry VIII. and
preserved in Sloan. MS. 5308, afford the best examples of ornaments of this description.

⁴ Broaches are explained by Forby to be “rods of sallow, or other tough and pliant
wood split, sharpened at each end, and bent in the middle ς used by thatchers to pierce
and fix tlieir work. Fr. broclze.’'

⁵ ‘⁴ A soudear for laeke of a brotche or a spyt, rosteth his meate upon his wepon
made lyke a broche.'’ HORM. Thomas, in his Principal Rules of Italian Grammar‚
1548, readers “stoceo, an armyng swoorde made like a broche.” In the Earl of
Northumberland's Household Book, 1511, it appears that the broches were turned by
a '⁴ child of the keching.” ANT. REP. IV. 233. Palsgrave alludes to the same primitive
usage, “ when you haue broched the meate (embroclle) lette the boye tourne, and come
you to cliurclie.''' See also Lelaml's Coll. VI. 4.
