Grammatice last described, but with considerable modifications and addi-
tions from other sources. Although comparatively of more frequent occur-
rence than the Promptorium, it is a book of great rarity. The earliest
edition hitherto noticed is that printed in 1500 by Wynkyn de YVorde in
small folio, ranging with the editio princeps of the Promptorium issued
from the prcss of Pynson in the previous year. It is indeed probable that
it may have been intended to supply an accompaniment to that Dictionary.
This rare editio princeps of the Ortus has not been carefully described;
the imperfect mention by Dibdin would lead us to suppose that, having
never examined a copy, he had relied on the brief notice by Herbert
chiefly derived from the Harlcian Catalogue‚ in which two copies are
enumerated, Nos. 5213, 5304 ; I have been unable to ascertain where
these may now be 101111119- There is, however, a copy of this first edition
among the books, chiefly MSS„ bequeathed by Junius to thc Bodleian3 it
is thus described in Tanner's Catalogue of that precious lexicographical
collection.——“ Hortus Vocabulorum, Impr. Lond. 1500, per WVynkyn de
Worde⁷ intersparsis Cl. Junii notis.’' Catal. MSS. Angliae‚ t. i. p. 251.
The following description has been taken from 3 fine copy of this edition
in the British Museum, in the Grenville Library.

Fo. 1 recta—‘⁴ ‘ll Ortus. Vocabulorum ''—the lower portion of the page
being blank.

Fo. 1 verso.—“ ἾῙ Prologus in librum qui ortus vocabulorum dicitur

⁸ Herbert, Typ. Ant.. vol. i. p. 136, Dibdin, vol. ii. p. 88. It is described by the

last-named author as in quarto, like the Subsequent editions by W. de Wmde, instead
