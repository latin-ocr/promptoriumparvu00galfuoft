catholicon, with this addition, “ Soinlar autem 'cel sotularis nihil (eliud est, ut dicit

is properly a thimble 3 chauncepe appears to be a corruption of the French chccussepiecl.}
³ Of the office of the chandeler in the household of a great lord, see the curicus poem
appended to the Boke of Curtasye, written about the time of Henry VI. Sloane MS.
1986, f. 46, b.
“ Now speke Ι wylle a lytulle whyle
Of the chandeler wyth-outen gyle,
That torches and tortes and preketes con make,
Perchours, smale condel, I vndertake.’'

Chandler signified not only the maker of canffles, but the candlestick, from the French
claamlelier. Thus in the Legenda Aurea mention occurs of a ‘⁶ chaundeler or candyl-
stycke‚” f. vii. b. See above CANDELERE, and the word chandler in Jamieson.

⁵ It has been stated that the usage of chanting in the English churches was introduced
by Osmund, Bishop of Sarum, 1090; but we learn from Bede that Benedict, Abbot of
XVeremouffi, brought Abbot John, the arch-chanter‚ from Rome to this country about
A.D. 678, at which period Archbishop Theodoric‚ a. Greek by birth, made a visitation of
the whole island, and caused instruction to be given in the art “sonos cantandi in
ecclesisi,” until then known only in Kent. Bede states even that at an earlier period in
the same century Paulinus left at York James the Deaeon, who was “ cantandi in
ecclesia peritzesz'musss’ and who ‘⁴ mayister ecclesiastice cantionis juxta morem Romanorum,
seu Canluariorum multis ccepz't eccistere.’‘ Bede, lib. ii. 40. See also lib. iv. 3, and
v. 20, and the appendix, edit. by Smith‚ p. 719. The most important treatises on the
subject of Church Music are those of St. Nicetus in the VIth century, and Aurelian in
the IXth, subsequent to the great change introduced by St. Gregory. A eurious notice of
the ancient system of notation has been given among the “ Instructions clu Comile' His-
tort'que. Colleclion de documents ineditsl' 1839. Chanting οι· “ deschaunt” was among
the practices violently opposed by Wickliffe, as was all Chureh-melody by the innovators
of a later period.
