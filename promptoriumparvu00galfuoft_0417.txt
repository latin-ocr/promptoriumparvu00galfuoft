² The received derivation of this term is that suggested by Minsheu, from the French
Pom-erte, the open turret or lantern on the roof of an house which permitted the escape
of smoke. In the article on dialeets in the Quart. Rev. lv. 373, the Icelandie 1i6ri,
foramen pinnaculi (lomus, is proposed as an etymon; the sort of cupola with a. trap-
door which, in the Northern countries, serves the double purpose ofa ehimney and a.
sky-light, is called in Norway liore, in W. Gothland liura. Loclium, a word unnoticed

signifying “a louer3 dicitur de lux et clo, quusi (lans lucem.” In the Latin-English
Vocab. Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII. are given “Lodz'am lucare, implecviare, lowere ;'' f. 27.
