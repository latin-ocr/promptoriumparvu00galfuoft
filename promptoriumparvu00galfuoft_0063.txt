APPENDix. 11

2. MS. in the Library of the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, 511611-
mark D. 2; it was entrusted to me by their kind permission through the
request of Sir Henry Ellis, to whom Ι acknowledge with pleasure my
frequent obligations⁴ It is written on paper in a small clear hand, 111
double columns, with initials in blue and red3 the English words also are
in red. It begins with the short prologue above noticed, but, part of the
leaf being torn away, the first lines are mutilated3 this prologue ends
thus—‘⁴ Et sic propter vocabulorum copiam liber iste Medulla gramatice
intitulatur.’' This MS. is in the original staniped binding with boards,
probably of oak3 it is doubtless the same which occurs in the list of
MSS. at Canterbury Cathedral about 1697, as ‘⁴ Dietionarium dictum Me-
dulla G1·a1nmaticae.⁷'²¹ This venerable relic of 11116611111-66111111)7 learning
has been regarded with special interest on account of the addition of
numerous Anglo-Saxon words, as supposed, by Somner3 the MS. of whose
Anglo—Saxon Dictionary is in the Canterbury Library. From the manner,
however, in which the Anglo-Saxon words are given, it may be infel-red
that they were, at least in part, taken from some Vocabulary in Soniner's
possession not his own compilation. The English portion is full, and
contains curious arehaisms, including a considerable proportion of words
noticeable as retained in North-country dialects.b

3. Harl. MS. 1000. An imperfect copy, ending with the words
‘⁴ stamen est filum 1616 01· warpe.” On paper3 written in a neat hand;
late fifteenth centur-3³3 with rubrications.

4. Harl. MS. 1738. The Medulla in a very abridged form, 111 a clear

on 1116 reverse is rudely sketebed with the pen Our Lord rising from the Sepulehre. On
the third leaf, vo. are two short Latin poenis in hexameter-s, the first beginning thus:
“Siccine tarn crebris frustra commentibus anglos ;” the second: ‘⁴ Conveniunt gallos
crebris conventibus angli.'‘ At the end ε “ Thys ys Ryebard ..... ys boke.’' It may
deserve mention that after certain words of ill omen the sign of the cross is found, thus:
Diabolus, the deuel. ᾖ Demon‚ the deuel. ἧς Dis, the deuel. ᾖ Comicius, the

fallinge euel. ᾖ Epileneia, the fallinge euel. ᾖ Febricito, to haue the seuerus, ᾖ

Genetarius, that vseth hore hous. ᾖ Ι have noticed occasionally a similar practice in
other MSS. of the period.
