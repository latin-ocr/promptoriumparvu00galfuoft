¹ “ A calle trappe, hamas, pedica? cmi. ANGL. “ Calan-apa, a caltrappe.” om. voc.
The Oatholicon gives the following explanation of hamus .· ‘⁶ Dicitur et hamus asser cum
clavis quo secbteyt'tur terra ιή vineis sub arbor-ihm defendendis, vel in domo circa scrinia et
thesauros, uc .ςί aliqnando far {uqi-edimur, ejus pedibas lnfiyatur.'' In the contemporary
poem describing the Siege of Rouen by Heni-y V. the city is said to have been defended
by a deep and wide dike, full of pitfalls, “ of a spere of heyth.”

“ Also sulle of ealtrappys hyt was sette
As meschys beth made wythinne a nette.” Archaeol. xxi. p. 51.

“ They hydde pretely vnder the grounde ealtroppys of yron to steke in horse or mennys
fete, murices ferreos leviter comdiderzmtff' HORM. Okazcssetmppe is explained by
Cotgrave to be an ‘⁴ iron engine of warre made with four sharp points, whereof one,
howsoever it is cast, ever stands upward.” Among the “ municyons and liabyllyments
of warre'' belonging to Berwick Cassse, 1539, occur “15 pece of lettes calteroopes.’'
Archaeol. xi. 439. Caltraps are mentioned by Quintus Curtius in the Life of Alexander
as having been spread over the ground by the Persians to annoy the Macedonian cavalry.
This circumstance is thus described, Kyng Alisaunder, line 64270:

“ And calketrappen maden ynowe,
In weyes undur wode and bowe,
Alisaundris men to aqwelle,
And synfulliche heom to spille.''

vegetius calls them tribuli. A representation of a caltrap, from the Tower collection,
will be found in Skelton’s Illustrations of the Armoury at Goodrich Court, ii. pl. 132.

¹2 The recipe in the Forme of Cury, p. 48, directs for “vyande Cypre of samone,
take almandus and bray hem unblaunched‚ take calwar samone, and seeth it in lewe
water‚'' &c. See also p. 75: “salwar salmone ysode.'' Palsgrave rendere “ caluer os
samon, escume de saulmoast’ This term appears to denote the state of the fish freshly
taken, when its substance appears interspersed with white fiakes like curd; thus in
Lancashire the fish dressed as soon as it is caught is termed calver salmon, and in North
Britain caller or callour signifies fresh, according to Jamieson. “ Quhen the salmondis
faillis thair loup, thay fall callour in the said caldmunis, and ar than maist delitious to
the mouth.” Bellend. Descr. Alb. c. 11. Calvered salmon is mentioned by Ben Jonson
and Massinger as a delicacy; and Isaac Walton applies the term to the grayling.
R. Holme, however, would make it appear that calver was a term applied to fish dressed
in oil, vinegar, and spices. See also Nares. The word “ caleweis,'’ which occurs in
Chaucer‚ Rom. of Rose, and has been by the earlier glossarists interpreted as calvured
salmon, is in the orlginal “poire de caillouel‚” a sort of sweet pear, called by Roquefort
caillos, or cailloel.

³ This word seems to be taken from the anch, ‘⁴ camus, qui α le nee court.’'
LACOMBE. Cotgrave renders camus, flat-nosed.

“ Round was his face, and camuse was his nose.’' enimc. Reve's Tale.

Hence also the sea-gull appears to have received a name, which is given by Elyot‚
Egctsscglzslpyccus, a sea-gull, or a camose.'' See Oamy, and Camow-nosed, in Jamieson's
