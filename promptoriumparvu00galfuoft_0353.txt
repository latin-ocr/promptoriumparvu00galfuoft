⁴ To hough, or hook the ham-strings, seems to be derivable from Ang.-Sax. hoh,
poples, or possibly the etymon heawan‚ secare, may be preferred. In the Wicliffite ver-
sion, Josh. xi. 6, it is written “thou shalt hoxe the horses, .s>nlmerval›ls‚” Vulg. A state-
ment in Rot. Parl. vi. 38, sets forth that in a riot in Yorkshire‚ 1472. one Rich. william-
son was “ speared, and hough synued.’'

of wyne the dreggis dwellen byneth, and the cliere wyne houeth aboue.'' Compare nova
of oyle, and FLETYN. The verb to hove, in the various sennes here given, appears to be
derived from hof, the past tense of Ang.—Sax. hebban, elevare.
