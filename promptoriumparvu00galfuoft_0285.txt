¹ The fute is the seent of a fox or beast of chace. Compare FEWTE, vestz‘yium, which

may be hence derived ; but the Glossarists have supposed it to be a corruption of multu-ier,
a keeper of the dog called in Freneh “ multo-e, a mongrel between a hound and a
maistiffe3 fit for the chase of wild bears and boar5.’' COTGR. Bp. Kennett notices the
term 111 his glossarial coll. Lansd. MS. 1033: “A feuterer, a dog-keeper3 the word is
corrupted from vanu-ier, Fr. vaultrier, Lat. veltrarius. one that leads a lime-bound. or
grey-hound for the chace.'' In a vocabularly written in the latter part of the XVth cent.
Harl. MS. 1002, f. 14 2, after “ “ haywarde, parcare,'' &e. occurs “ Redeo-arius, a fewterer.''
Nares cites several passages in which this term is used.

of the dyamandes, alle thoughe I tarye my matere for a tyme, to the ende that thei that
knowen hem not be not disceyved be gabberes (Fr. barratours) that gon be the eontree,
that sellen hem.'’

that ‘¹ before the fende fader of lesyngus was lowside‚ was never this gabbyng eontryvede.”
