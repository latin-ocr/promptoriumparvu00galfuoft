(25.) “ Lesclarcissement de la langue ancoysess’ by John Palsgrave,
1530.-A minute description of this important book, which is dedicated to
Henry VHD is given by Dibdin, and more recently by M. Gemn in the
Introduction to the reprint edited by him for the collection of “ Documents
Inedjts sur l'histoire de F rance.⁷’b The work, the earliest existing grammar
of the French tongue, consists of rules for pronunciation, 3 ¹very full voca·
bulary of substantives in English and French alphabetically arranged,
similar tables of pronotinS, adjectives, and other parts of speech, an
ample list of verbs being specially valuable to the student of obsolete
expressions, on account of the quaint sentences by which each verb 15
illustrated. The author, who styles himself in the Title “ Angloys natyf
de Londres, et gradue' de Paris,'⁷ and who studied also both at Cambridge
and Oxford, had been chosen to instruct the Lady Mary, sister of Henry
ῩΠΙ.τ previously to her marriage with Louis XII. In the Privy Purse
Expenses of Henry VIII„ 1513, Palsgrave is designated ‘⁴ scolemaster to
my lady PrinceS,” and he accompanied her to F rance in the following year.
His services are very favorably recognised by Henry in the privilege for
seven years prefixed to the work, and dated Sept. Ξ, 22 Ηο11. VIII. (1530),
shortly after its completion, as thus stated in the colophon,—“ The imprint-
yng fynysshed by Johan Haukyns the XVIII. daye of July,” in the year
beforementioned. It has, however, been supposed that- the book may have
been produced from the press of Pynson, by whom it is certain that copies
were sold under the author‘s direction.c On his return from France with
the youthful Queen, Palsgrave was much in request as a teacher of the
young nobility; he enjoyed considerable prefer-ment in the chureh, and
was collated by Cranmer to the rectory of St Dunstan's in the East,

copy of the work was found in France in the Bibliotheque Mazarine. A reprint of the
rare grammar by Giles Dewes before described is given in the same volume, and an
ample Index to Palsgrave’s work is a most valuable accessory to this reprint.

⁰ In a letter to Cromwell from Stephen Vaughan, who was very desimus to obtain
a copy of the work, it is said that Palsgrave had instrueted Pynson to sell it only to
such persons as he might direct, “lest his proffit by teching the Frenche tonge myght

be mynished by the sale of the same.'‘' Sir H. Ellis, Orig. Letters. third series, vol. ii.
