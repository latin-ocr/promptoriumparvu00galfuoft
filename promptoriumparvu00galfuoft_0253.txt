¹ “Fastyngangc, carniprivlum.'⁹ CATH. ANG. Palsgravc gives “at fastyns, at
Fastyngonge, ὰ Quaresme prenant.’' Blount‚ in his Dictionary of Har-d XVoMs, 1680,
gives “fasguntide” as a Norfolk word, which Forby considers as now obsolete. In
the statement made by the citizens of Norwich respecting a riot that occurred in 1441,
termed Gladman's Insurrection² they declare that it originated in the circumstance that
the said Thomas Glatlrnan “on Tuesday, in the last ende of Cristemesse, viz. Fastyn-
gonge Tuesday, made a disport with his neyghbours, coronned as Kyng of Cristemesse.’'
Blomf. Hist. ii. 111. A (letailed account of such local usages at Shrove-tide will be
found in Brand’s Popular Antiq. vol. i. Hardyng‚ relating the conflict between the -
Yorkists and Queen Margaret, which closed with the battle of St. Alban's‚ Shrove
Tuesday, Febr. 17, 1461, says,

“ And southward came thei then therfore
To Sainct Albones, vpon the fastyngange eue (αἰ. fastirne.)'' Chron. c. 237.

The term is eompounded from Ang.-SaX. faesten, jejuaimn, and gong, iter, or going,
the commencement of Lent. ‘⁴ Caresme premant, Fastnes, or Shrove Tuesday.’'
COTG.

² “A fatte, cupa, cum. A fattmaker, cuparius.’' CATH. ANG. “Cupa, a coupe,
01· a fatte, or stope.” ORTUS. “Fatte, a vessel, quevzce. Fatte to dye in, cvuier ὰ
taimlre.'’ PALSG. “Ouve, an open tub, a fat, or vat.'' co'rG. Ang.-Sax. faet, fat, vas.
Caxton, in the Book for Travellers, enumerates “thinges that ben vsed after the hous,
—platers, disshes, saussers, sallyers‚ trenchours; these thinges shall ye fynde of trec,
and of erthe. Now after, a disshe sat (escult‘er) where me leyeth therin the forsaid
thinges, and the spones of tree.'' There was a local measure of grain, called a fat,
identical with the cupa, capus, or εῑιυα, and which contained a quarter, or 8 bushels.
The Stat. 1 Hen. V. e. 10, recites that it had been ordained that there should be only
one measure, namely 8 bushels to the quarter3 but that the purveyors of the Crown
were aceustomed to take 9, and the merchants and citizens of London take of all sellers
the same quantity, as a quarter of wheat, “par un mesure use‘ deins Za dicte Οίτέε,
appell& le faat, ove un huss-cll mys sar le dit faat.'' The word coupe does not occur in
the Promptorium‚ in the same sense as FATE, but is so given in the Ortus and the
Oath. Ang. “A cowpe‚ cupa. A cowper, czzparc'us.” Caxton says in the Book for
Travellers, ‘⁶ Paule the couper maketh and formaketh the keupis (reficiet les caue-s.)''
