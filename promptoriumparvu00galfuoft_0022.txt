ments to undertake a task which has now, after many unsoreseen impedi-
ments, been brought to completion. I will not, however, consume time in
secking to propitiate those whose indulgence Ι might hope to win, for
shortcomings and imperfectioris which no one perhaps can more truly esti-
mate or regret than myself. The student of early literature who has
engaged in the minute toils which such an undertaking demands, or in
the wearisome labor of collation, may be willing perhaps to regard with
leniency deficiencies and even inaccuracies into which the editor may have
been betrayed in the course of his work.

The special subjects to which I have limited my observations in the
following preliminary notices may be thus stated :—

Ι. The author of the Promptorium‚ with such traces as may be found
of his history or of his literary labors.

ΙΙ. The sources froin which his Latinity was derived.

III. The MSS. of the work, and also the printed editions which have been
available in the preparation of this volume.

Ι. We are enabled to ascertain with certainty, from the author's own
statement given in the Harleian MS. at the close of his Precmbuluwz, that the
Promptorium was compiled by a Dominican Friar of Lynn Episcopi, N or—
folk, A.D. 1440.ὃ This monastery of Black Friars or Friars-Preachers
stood in the eastern part of the town. Few traces of it are now to be seen.
It is believed that this house existed in the reign of Edward 1.‚ and was
founded by Thomas Gedney.b An anchorage is stated to have belonged
to it,C and herein possibly the author, who describes himself as “ fratrem

⁶ There was a cli-apel of St. Catherine in the conventual church, and with this chapel
probably the above-mentioned anchorage was connected. Henry le Despeneer, Bishop
of Norwich, wrote a letter to the mayor and burgesses of Lynn‚ 5 Rich. ΙΙ. desiring
that they would grant their part of the house of St. Catherine to John Consolif‚ a servant
of Lord le Despencer, the bishop's brother, there to live a solitary life upon the alms
of the good people ; the other partos the house, belonging to the Arehdeaeon of Norwich,
having been before granted to the said John Consolyf. Blomefield‚ ut supra, p. 513.
There was a remarkable hermitage at Lynn, in a cave on the sea-shore, in the bishop’s
marsh, at a spot called ‘⁴ Lenne Crouch,'' where, as appears by a document dated 1349,

a losty cross, 110 feet in height, had been erected for the benefit of seafaring men. But
hermits and recluses were essentially different.
