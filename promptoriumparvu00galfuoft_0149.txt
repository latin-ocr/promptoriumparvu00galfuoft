brayre. There is a deer kylled, for Ι here hym bray.'⁷ PALSG.

2 “A brakane, filix& a brakanbuske, sillem-izmff’ (ΕΑ-[Ἡ. ANGL. “Filias, Anqlz'ce,
ferne ox· brakans.” ORT. voc. “ Brake, ferne, βυθῶν-εἶ’ PALSG. In the Household
Book of the Earl of Northumberland, 1511, it appears that water of braks was stilled
yearly, for domestic use. Ray gives the word brakes as generally used ; it is retained in

Norfoik and Suffolk. See FORBY and NARES.

³ ‘⁸ A brake, pinsella, vibra, rastellum.” CATH. ANGL.

⁴ “ He wyll nat cease fro surfettynge‚ tyll he be reddy to parbralze.” HORM. “ To
parbrake, vnmc'r. It is a shrewde turne, he parb1-akeththus.'' PALSG. This word does
not occur again in its proper place in the Promptorium. See Braking, in Jamieson.

⁵ It is not a little singular to find so many notices as occur of Brasil-wood, eon-
siderably anterior to the discovery of Brasil‚ by the Portuguese Captain, Peter Alvarez
Capi-alis, which occurred 3d May, 1500. He named it the land of the Holy Cross,
“since of store of that wood. called Brasill.'' Purchas's Pilgrimes, vol. i. It is probable
that some wood which supplied a red dyc had been brought from the East Indies, and
received the name of Brasil, long previous to the discovery of America. See Huetiana,
p. 268. In the Canterbuiy Tales, the host, commending the Nonne's preeste for his

health and vigour, says,

‘⁴ Him nedetli not his colom· for to dien,
With Brasil, ne with grain of Portingale.''

Among the valuable effeets of Henry V. taken shortly after his decease in 1422, there
occur '‘ii. qrazmdes peaes clu Bmcile, pris vi. s. mii. d.” ROT. PARL. In Sloan. MS.
2584, p. 3, will be found directions ‘¹ for to make brasil to florische lettres, or to rewle

wyth bookes.”
