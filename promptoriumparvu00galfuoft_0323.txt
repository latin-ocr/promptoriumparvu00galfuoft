¹ Forby explains hay-net as signifying in Norfolk ‘⁴ a hedge net, 3 long low net, to
prevent hares or rabbits from escaping to covert‚ in or through hedges.” See also

a hay to inclose or intangle wild beasts in. Pan, a toyle or hay wherewith wild beasts are

the edition of the Ortus in Mr. Wi1b1·aham's libi-ary, clausura is rendered “ a closse, or
a heye.'’ Haye occurs elsewhere in the sense of an enclosure; thus in the gloss on the
“liber vccalus eqmcs,'' called in the Promptorium ·‘Dz'stiyius,’' written by John de
Garlandia‚ occurs ‘¹ Cimiterz'um, chy-rehe-hayess’ Harl. MS. 1002. In the Golden

welke (testudo), a frame of goode tymber, shaped square, keuerede and hillede alle
a-boute wythe rawe hides, or with festes, and heyres, for drede of b1·ynnyng.'' Roy. MS.
18 A. XlI. f. 105. Among the trades, in the order of the pageants of the Play of
Corpus Christi, at York, 1415, “hayresters'’ are mentioned. Drake, App. In the
Golden Legend the term hayre is of frequent occurrence, signifying 3 garment of morti-
fication. St. Thomas clothed himself with an “hard heyre, full of knostes, whiche was
his sherte, and his breche was of the same.'' And again, during grievous pestilenee,
“ they couered the crosso and the auters with blyssed hayres; and thus we sholde take on
vs clothyng of penaunce.” In medieval Latin a shaggy garment was termed Ιιαίνα,
according to Ducange. Ang.-Sax. heora, cilicium.
