marriage of Philip and Mary in 1554, the Bishops present had their “erosiers carried
before them.'’ Leland, Coll. 1v. 398. Fox says that Bonner, who was then Bishop of
London, at the degradation of Dr. Taylor in 1555, would not strike him with his
“crosier-staff” upon the breast, lest he should strike again. Minsheu says that
“ 01006 15 a shepherd’s crooke in our old English ς hence the staffe of a Bishop is called
the 0100161 or crosier.”

¹ “A croser, craczfcrarz'as, crucifer? CATH. ANG. In the relation of the mar-
tyr-dom of St. Thomas of Canterbury it is said that “ one Syr Edward Gryme, that was
1115 moysen put forthe his arme with the crosse to bere of the stroke. and the stroke
smote the erosse on sonderJ' Legenda Aur. At the first progress of Henry VII. after
1115 coronation, during the solemnities at York, the Arehbishop's “suffragan was eroyser,
and bar the Archebisshops erosse.'' Lel. Coll. ΙΙΙ. 192. It appears, however, by the
Promptnrium, that the appellation CROCERE denoted also the bearer of a pastoral staff,
or erosier. In this sense Higins, 111 the version of Junius’ Nomenclator, 1585, renders
“ lituus, a erosier's staffe, or a Bisliop’s staffe.'’

² This word, signifying a staff with an hooked end, 15 51111 retained among the pro-
vineialisms of Norfolk and Suffolk, and is traced by Forby to the sselg. crom. uacus.

³ Fm-hy gives emp, as the name applied to the craw of a bird, Teut. kmp, stomachus.-
according to ι1510165011 it signifies the same in N. Britain, and also the human stomach.
