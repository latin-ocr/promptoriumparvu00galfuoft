leyalz's, licitus. Lefulle, licitus, faustus.
ANG. “ Leyz'tz'mo, to make lawfull.
faetus. Lei-itus, lefull.” ORTUS.

Compare LAWFULLE, leyitimus, p. 989, and LEFULLE, or lawfulle, licitus,
The etymology of the two words is manifestly distinct, the first being derived

‘⁸ Lawfulle‚
anefulle, illicitus, illecebrosus.” CATH.

Leyitimus, bonus, secundum legem habitus, vel
By Wieliff this last word is written ‘⁶ leveful,'’

which approaches more closely to the original orthography, and the distinction is ob-
served by the old writers. W. Thorpe, in his examination by Abp. Arundel, 1407,
stated that he had said that the law of Holy Church teaehes in the decrees that no
servant ought to obey his lord, child his parent, or wife her husband, ‘⁶ except in lefull
things and lawfull.¹’ This document was published by Tindal from Thorpe's autograph.
The same phrase occurs in the Statutes of the Gild of St. Francis at Lynn, 1454, re-
garding the summons of the fraternity ‘⁶ in lefull and lawfull tyme.'' Richards, vol. i.
478. Palsgrave renders both ‘⁴ laufull’' and ‘⁴ 1efu11,’‘ Freneh, ‘⁶ licite. loysz'ble.'’

‘2 Compare LYsTY, delectabilis, p. 307 ; LUSTY, or lysty, delectuosus, p. 317. Aug.-
Sax. lystan, velle, θυμω-9,· lystlice, libenter. Hence the negative listless, indifferent,
having no desire. See OWLYST man, Deses.

⁴ This word is placed between oxsixmm’fsr and ON-WYNDYN‚ as if written oN-
quLMYiv. Compare OVYR QWELMYSJ, p. 374, TURNDN, or qwelman, and wflELMYN.
