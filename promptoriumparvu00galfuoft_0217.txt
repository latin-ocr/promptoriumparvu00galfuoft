¹ DAWNCYN', MS. “ To dawnte, blandilraclare‚” CATH. ANGL. In N. Britain to
dawt has the same signification. See Jamieson. In the vision of Piers Ploughman to
daunt appears to mean to tame by kind treatment3 the allusion is to the dove which
was trained by Mahomet to come to his ear for her food.

“ Thorugh his sotile wittes
He daunted a dowve.'' Vision, line 1042.

In Norfolk to daunt is used in the sense of knocking down, Fr. demptam as by Pals-
grave, “To dawnte, mate, overcome‚ je malle. Lydgat. This terme is yet scarsly
admitted in our comen spetche.’'

given by Arnold, in the Customs of Lond0n‚ p. 90, inquiry is ordered to be made “ yf
ther be ony eomon ryator, bat-ratur, διο. dwelling wythin the warde.’' The term is
taken from the French baratenr, in low Latin baratarius, which have the same
meaning.
