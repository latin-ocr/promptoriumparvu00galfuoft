¹ Siqzharium, MS. The distinction between MV of hawkys, p. 347, and a mew for fatting
poultry, deser-ves notice. Chaucer uses the word in the latter sense, Cant. T. 351.

2 This instrument of martial music appears to have been a sort of drum, of Oriental
origin, and introduced into Europe by the Crusaders. Joinville speaks of the minstrels
of the Soudan, “ qui avoient cors Sarrazz'nnoz‘s, et labours, et παραίνεε ,·” the term
being evidently identical with the naqarah‚ or drum of the Arabs and Moors. See
Ducange, v. Nacara, Roquefort, and VVachter. Menage, and other writers, supposed
the naeac're to be a kind of wind-instrument, but the observations of Ducange on Join-
ville, p. 59, and the remarks of Daniel, Milice Franc. i. p. 536, prove beyond question
that it was a drum. Cotgrave, however, gives “ Naquaire, a lowd instrument of
musicke, somewhat resembling a hoboy.'’ Nakerys are mentioned in Gawayn and
the Grene Kny3ht, v. 118, 1016; and Chaucer⁷s Knight's T. V. 2513. Froissart re-
lates that Hugh Despenser the younger, being taken by the Queen's army in 1326, was
led about “ apres le route de ἶα Royne, par tontes les villos ou ils passoyent, ᾰ trompes
et nacaires.¹' Vol. i. c. xiii. Amongst the minstrels in the household of Edw. III.
1344, is named “ makerers, j.“ which may be erroneously written for nakerer‚ but in
the Gesta Ludov. VII. c. 8, it is said ‘⁴ tympanis et macariis, et aliis similibus· instru-
mentis resonabant.⁷‘ See Household Ordin. p. 4, Harl. MS. 782, p. 63. Sir John
Maundevile relates that near the River Phison is the Vale perilous, in which “ heren men
often tyme grete tempestes—and gret noyse, as it were sown of tabours‚ and of nakeres,
and trompes, as thoughe it were a gret feste.'’ Voiage, p. 340. Trevisa, in his version
of Barthol. de Propr. lib. xix. c. 141, says that ‘⁶ Armonia Rithmiea is a sownynge
melody—and diuers instrumentes serue to this maner armony, as tabour, and timbre,
harpe, and sawtry, and nakyres.’' Palsgrave gives ‘¹ nauquayre, a kynde of instrument,
naquaz'r.'’ The precise period when the use of drums as martial music was adopted by
the English is uncertain ; R. Gloue. p. 396, alludes to their Saracenic origin, and
describes the terror caused thereby, so that the horses of the Christians were “ al
astoned.'' Nakers were used at the battle of Halidown-Hill, 13:32, as appears by the
“ Romance‚“ or ballad on that victory, Harl. MS. 4690, f. 803 they are termed tabers
in the prose account of the same, f. 79, v⁰. Minot says, in his poem on the alliance of
Edw. ΙΙΙ. with the Duke of Brabant, and other foreign powers, 1336, and their pre-
parations for war with Philip de Valois,

“ The princes, that war riche on raw,
Gert nakers strike, and trumpes blaw.·'

The NACORNE, or nacaire, was probably the small kettle-drum, used in pairs, as seen
in the figures given by Strutt, Horda, vol. i. pl. vi. from the Liber Regalis, written
during the reign of Rich. ΙΙ. The most curious representation is that etched by
Carter, in his Ancient Sculpture and Painting, from a carved miserere, of the close of
