lx APPENDIX.

Besides the editions issued from the press of W'ynkyn de Worde, two
printed in France, and not mentioned by Dibdin 01· other bibliographers,
remain to be noticed. The first of these was printed for Jaques Cousin, of
Rouen, in 1520. The only copy known to me is in the Grenrille Library
in the British Museum. In dimensions and general arrangement, the book
closely resembles the small quartos by W. de Worde 3 on the first leaf is
introduced a woodcut of the arms of the city of Rouen, the escutcheon is
supported by two 131113, and over it on a scroll is the motto “ In te iesu

spes mea.⁷ On the field of the escutcheon appear the printer’s initials,
and under it is a 301011 inscribed “ vJaques: cousin.q The title is as
follows, printed at the head of the page, over the woodcut :—

“ ‘J Ortus vocabulorum Alphabetico ordine fere omnia que 111 Catholico.
BreuiloquiO. Cornucopia. Gemma vocabulorum atque Medulla grammatice
ponuntur, 011111 vernacule lingue Anglicane expositione continens: nouiter
Impressus Anno salutis vicesimo supra millesimum et quingentesimum.
Die vero vicesima septima mensis Juniis*

On the reverse of the leaf is found the “Prologus‚” as before. The
dictionary is printed in double columns, Sign. A. ii. to LL. iii. On the
reverse of the last leaf is the colophon :—

“ Adest studiosissimi . , . . Quum igitur summa diligentia sit collectum
vigilantique studio correctum : vt maius in lucem prodiret ε ipsum a viris
studiosis comparamlum esse constat. Impressum. Per Magistrum Petrum
Oliuier optimis caracteribus. Anno salutis christiane vigesimo supra
millesimum et quingentesimum Die vero quinta mensis Οο10111·13.”ἃ

Dimensions, Τξ 11101103 by 5 inches. Mr. Grenville observed that this
edition is not mentioned by Panzer, Maittaire, or in any work which he
had seen.

The second edition, to which allusion has been made as produced on the
continent, was likewise printed at Rouen, at the joint costs of a bookseller
of that city and of another, John Gachet, ‘⁴ mercatoris librarii,” as he is
elsewhere designated, and who appears to have carried on his trade at

Rouen in 1521 by Peter Oliver for Jaques Cousin. Ι 3111 unable to account for the

discrepancy in date which may be noticed in the colophon as compared with the title,

unless we may suppose that the printing commeneed on June 27, and that nearly four
months were required for its completion.
