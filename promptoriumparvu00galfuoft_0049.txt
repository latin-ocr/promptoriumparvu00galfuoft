4. MS. in the Chapter Library, WVinchester Cathedra13 on perper, con-
sisting of 114 leaves3 dimensions 13} inches by 10 inches.a The writing
is in double columns, in a bold clear hand without any rubrication. The
text resembles that of Harl. MS. 221, but it is by no means identicalg
some words which occur in the other MSS. or in the edition printed by
Pynson, but are not in the Harl. MS„ being here found. The verbs from
CLYVYN or ryvyn to Cownru, inclusive, accidentally omitted in the Harl.
MS.foccur here, and they have been supplied in the present edition chiefly
from this MS. The errors of the scribe are few and of slight importance3
