“ As dooth a kex or a candle‚
That caught hath fir and blaseth.” 11,804.

In an Herbal‚ the date of which is perhaps contemporary with the Promptofiums, it is
said that there are two speci& of hemlock‚ “tame and wilde. The 2 spice is cowh
ynowh‚ to mykel, saf fore pore mennys eldynge‚ and childus pleynge3 ,bey callen it be
grete homeloc 3 the stalkes stonden whit and ser euery3ere. In some contre it is called
kex, in some contre wodewhistel.'' Arund. MS. 42, f. 23. Eldynge here signifies fuel;
see EYLDYNGE, above, p. 136. Allusion is made to the use of the stallis of hemlock
instead of eandles, in Turn. of Tottenham, 201. “Erucu, a humlocke, or a keyclogge.''
ORTUs. ‘⁴ Keckes of humblockes, tviau. Kickes, the drie stalke of humlockes or
burres, ivyzw. Kirna, tcismfi' PALSG. “Sagapa-ium, a gumme οι· rosyn, whiche
runneth out of a kyxe or tree‚ called ιἢενῑιίαΝ ELYo'r. ‘⁶ Canon de suls, a kex or
hollow stick, or branch of elder, or a pot-gun made thereof. Seque, Hemlocke, hom-
loeke, herbe Bennet, Kex.’' COTG. “ Kecks, i. hollow stallis and sciolis, cremium.''
GOULDM. Holland, in his version of Pliny, B. xxv. c. 7, says that the stem of gentian
“ is hollow as a kex‚” and void withim and of line or flax, B. xix. c. 1, that “ the long
buns of the stalkes—will serve very well to maintaine fire under kills and leads.”
Shakespeare speaks of “hateful docks, rough thissses, kecksies, burs3 the proverbs‚ as
dry as a kex, as hollow as a gun or as a kex, are common ; and the word is still used
provincially. See Brockett, Craven, Hallamshire, Salopian, Wiltshire Glossaries, διο.

“ Kech, kaxes, or knies, α Fr. G. cigsue, utrumque (ι Lat: cicuta.'' SKINNER. Bunne, .

given here as synonymous with kyx, is so given iikewise previously, p. 55; where
ΒυλἻςῩΥΒΕ, the reading of the MS, appears to be erroneous: the King‘s Coll. MS. gives
Bunne, kyx, but possibly a kid or faggot of buns may be intended. This word occurs in
the later Wieliffite version, Isai. i. 31. “ And 3oure strengthe schal be as a deed sparcle
of bonys (either of herdis of flex) 3³³ in another MS. “ bones (eiber of herdis)‚'' where
three of the MSS. give ‘⁶ stobil‚” and the earlier version “ sparke of a flax top (favilla
stupas* Vulg.) Ang.-Sax. bune,fistzt.la.

¹ —gnaste, or a kandel. anuctura, MS. “Emungyo, id est sordes (misem-e de miso
vel camlelti, to snufl'e. Emuaetorz'mn, a snuffynge 5ron.” ORTCS. In the earlier Wie-
cliffite version in the Bodl. MS. by the first hand, Isai. i. 31 is thus rendered: “ And
3oure strengthe shal ben as a gnast of a flax top (fitz-illa stupoe‚ Vulg.) and 3oure werk
as a sparcle (sez‘ae2'lla)‚” where the corrected reading of the ordinary copies, instead of
“ gnast‚” is “ deed sparkess’ in the later version “ deed sparcle.'' ‘⁶ Lichiwm, gnaiste
or knast of a candell. Lz'cltitzuffi gnast of be candyl.'' MED. ‘⁶ Lz'cle'inus‚ candell
weykess' ORTUS. In the Winch. MS. this word not only occurs in its proper place, but
is repeated at the end of the letter K after the word KUNY, as follows: “ musra, or
gnaste off a candel. Almo. Vei-saw,- Est nasi mmo, candele sii tihi wmco.’' This was
perhaps a marginal addition, misplaced by the transcriber. Compare Dan. gnist. Swed.
gnista, Icel. gneisti, scintilla.

² The term knave long retained the simple meaning of the Ang -Sax. enafa‚ puer : thus,
in the Wicliffite version, “peperit filiunt *masculum-'⁷ Vulg. is rendered “ sche bere a
knaue child.'' Apoc. xii. 5. Chaucer says of Griselde‚

 

“ She a daughter hath 5b0re,
Ail had hire lever hau horne a knaue child.'’ Clerk's Tale.
