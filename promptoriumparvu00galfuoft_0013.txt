barbarisms of a debased Latinity, which, displeasing‚

of information to the archaic student.

It has been found impossible to preserve the perfect
regularity of alphabetical arrangement, in consequence
of the disorder that had been introduced by the scribe,
who, writing more by ear than careful observation of
