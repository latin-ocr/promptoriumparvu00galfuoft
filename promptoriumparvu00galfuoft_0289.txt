quaintly-fashioned water-spouts in the forms of men or monsters with yawning mouths,
of which medieval architectum presents so endless a variety, is taken from the French.
“ Gargyle in a wall, ya7yoz'lle.'' PALSG. See also Roquefort‚ v. Gcmyoz'le. Horman says,
“ Make me a trusse standing out upon gargcllys, that Ι may se about: podium, suy-
9estwn, vel pulpitum, quod mattulis irmitalur. I wyll haue gargyllis under the beamys
heedis ι mutulos, sive proceres, (stef Elyot renders “frzmnen, the vppermoste parte of the
throte, the gargyll.” A remarkable application of the gargoyle in architecture occurs on
the south side of Notre Darne, at Paris3 all the piscinas of the apsidal chapels surround-
ing the choir of that side being furnished with external gargoyles. which are fashioned
like the upper parts of a lion, or dragon, and answer the purpose of the ordinary interior
drains, which served to allow the water used in ablutions at the altar to pass into the
earth. Their date is of the XIIIth cent. and nothing of a similar kind has been noticed
in this country.

¹ In the Creed of Piers Ploughman is a curious and graphio description of a monas-
tery, with its numerous and stately buildings,

‘⁴ with gaye garites and grete,
And iche holc y-glased.” line 425.

A GARYTTE was, in the original sense of the term. a watch tower, or look—out, on the roof
osa house, or castle wall, called yurila, in French querite. In the version of Vegecius.
Roy. MS. 18 A. ΧΠ. it is said of the defence of a camp, and kecping wal ch by night, “ it
is nat possible algate to haue highe garettcS, or toures, or high places for watche nien,
therfor it nedethe to haue out watclie.” B. iii. e. 8. Caxton, in the Book for Travellers,
says ¹⁴ of thinges that ben vsed after the hous,—hit behoucth to the chambreS. loftes, and
garenis, sollici-s, gymnico-⁸3¹ cotgrave explains yaritte, or ¹querite, to bc a place of refuge
from surprise, made in a rampart; a sentry, or watch-tower; and “tourel ὰ cul de
lampe, a small out-juttyng garret, or tower like a garret, on the top ofa walle.” See
somam: hereafter.

² A garnish signified commonly the set or service of pewter‚ and likewise, in more
stately establishments, of more precious material. Previously to the introduction of fictile
ware of an ornamental description in the latter part of the XVIth cent. the ordinary ser-
vice of the tables of our ancestors was on vessels of pewter, the silver plate being for the
most part reserved to decorate the cupboard, or bufl'et. Har-rison, in his description of
Eng. written about 1580, speaking ot* the great skill to which English pewterers had
attained, says, ‘⁶ Such furniture of household of this mettall‚ as we commonlie call by the
name of vessell, is sold usuallie by the garnish, which dooth conteine 12 platters, 12 dishes,
12 saucers, and those are either of siluer fashion, or else with brode or narrow briins, and
bought by the pound‚ which is now valued at six or seuen pencc, or peraduenture at
eight pence. In some places beyond the sea a garnish of good flat English pewter of an
ordinarie making, . . . is esteemed almost so pretious as the like number of vessels that
are made of fine siluer, and in maner no less desired, amongst the great estates, whose
workmen are nothing so skillful in that trade as ours.'' Holirsh. Chron. i. 237. In the
inventory of the college of Bishop Auckland, A.D. 1498, the silver plato having hoen
described, there are enumerated ‘⁶ xx pcwdcr plateis, xij pcwdcr dishcs, viij salsers,
j garnishe of vessell.'' Wills and Inv. Surt. Soc. i. 101.
