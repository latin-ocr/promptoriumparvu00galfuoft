saken his fayth, and is worse than a misbeleued man :” (in the Wicliffite version, ‘⁴ his
owne, and moost of his household men.’') Here, and in Gal. V. 10, Wicl. version, the
word seems to be used precisely in the sense given to it in the Promptoriun1; but it
denotes also familiar, by acquaintance, and presuming. ‘⁶ Homely, famylier, through a
quaynted,famz'lier. Homelynesse, pm'uanlte‘. Homely, sauoye, to perte, malctpertW
PALSG. Horman says that ‘⁴ homelynesse (fiducia) eomynge of a true harte, is a maner
of vertue‚” where it seems to imply familiar confidence; and he uses the word also as
follows: “ He was homely with her, or had to do with he1·.''

¹ It should seem that the eala, or swatan of the Anglo-Saxons, were not compounded
with any bitter condiment, which was essential to the concoction of beer, a drink of
Flemis'n or German origin, and until the XVIth cent. imported from the Continent, or
brewed by foreigners only in this country. The Promptorium gives BERE, cervisia
hunmzulma, as distinguished from ale, which was not hopped ; Caxton, in the Boke f01·
Travellers, speaking of drinks‚ makes the distinction, “Ale of England, Byre of Ale-
mayne ; ’' and it appears by the Customs of London, Arnold’s Chron. 87, that beer was
first made in London by “byere brewars‚ straungers—Flemyngis, Duchemen,” &c. a
recipe for making single beer with malt and hops is given, p. 247. It has been asserted
that the use of hops was forbidden by Hen. VI. in consequence of a petition of the Com-
mons, mentioned by Fuller, in his Worthies, under Essex, against “the wicked weed
called hops ; ” but no record of the prohibition has been found, and the petition does not
appear on the Rolls of Parliament. In the time of Hen. VIII. some prejudice seems to
have arisen regardiug their use, for among the articles for the reform of sundry misuses
in the royal household, 1531, is an injunction to the brewer not to put any hops 01· brim-
stone into the ale. Archaeol. iii. 157. Hops‚ called in Dutch Hoppe, Germ. Hopfl'en,
were introduced into England from Armis, between 10 and 15 Ηο11. VIII. as affirmed
in Stowe's Chron. about the time of the expedition against Tournay. Bullein, in the
“ Bulwarke of Defenee‚” written about 1550, speaks of hops as growing in Suffolk. They
are mentioned in the stat. 5 and 6 Edw. VI. 0. 5, 1552, as cultivated in England; Stat.
of Rea1m‚ iii. 135. Among the privileges eonceded to the strangers from the Low
Countries‚ who settled at stamford, 1572, is a clause regarding the free exer-eise of hus-
bandry, in which are specified hops, and all things necessary to gardens. Strype, Life of
Parker, App. 115. The management of hops was quickly acquioed, as appears by the
instructions given by Tusser, in March’s and June's husbandry, published 1557.
See also the Treatise by Reyn. Seott, 1574; and Harrison's Descr. of Britain, Holinsh.
i. 110. The remarks of Leonard Maseall in his Art of Planssng, under the head of
“ certeyne Dutch practises,’¹ p. 85. edit. 1592, are detailed, and curious; and he
appears to have been conversant with the method adopted in Flanders. The stat. 1
Jac. I. c. 18, against the deterioration of hops, shows that a large quantity was still
supplied in 1603 from foreign parts. See Beckman's Hist. of Inventions, iv. 325, and
Oullum‘s Hawstcd, 2o2.
