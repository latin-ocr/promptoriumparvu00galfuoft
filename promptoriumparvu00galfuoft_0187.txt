coarse stoekings without feet, used as gaiters. In a MS. of the Medulla in the Editor’s
possession, Culponeus is rendered “a carl stoghe,'' (in the Ortus “a ehorles shoo‚'’)
with this additional explanation, “vel a Cokyr, ut dicit Campus florum.’' Piers
Ploughman speaks of his “cokeres‚'⁹ Vision, line 3915, and they may be seen in the
curious drawing in a MS. of the Poem in the Library Trin. Coll. Cant. an engraving
from which is given in Shaw's Dresses. Elyot gives ‘⁴ ΟαφῬαίιίιοε, ploughmen’s bootes
made of vntanned lether, they maye be called cokers. Peronatus, he that weareth rawe
lether shoen, boteux, or cokars lyke a ploughman.” Librarie, 1542.

¹ Junius compares this word with the Dutch, kokerillen, celebrare hilaria, but Lye
is inclined to trace its etymology to the Welsh, cocr, indulyens. The use of the term
is fully illustrated by Palsgrave. “To eoker, cherysshe to moche‚ miynotter. This
boye caune never thriue, he is cokered so moche. To coker, bring up with daynty
meates, affriander, (ff·i0ller. Ooker hym up thus in his youthe, and you shall haue a
fayre caulfe of hym shortly.'' See below, COOKERYNGE ΜΕΤΕ.

² This singular term was given most erroneously in the printed editions of the Promp-
torium; Pynson printed it Ckyrmete, Julian Notary Chyimete, and W. de Worde
Chymette. It appears to relate to the kind of rustic boot called here a cocur, and cokyr ;
but the whimsical applieation of such a term to clay is wholly unaccountable.

³ Among numerous instances, resin, grease, and herbs, mentioned in the curious
directions for making a good ‘⁴ entreet‚” or plaster to heal wounds, occurs ‘⁴ Spaynisch
code.'' Sloan. MS. 100, f. 17.

⁴ Elyot renders ‘⁴ Sepia, a fyshe called a cuttell. Loliyo, a fyshe whiche hath his
head betwene his seete and his bealy, and hath also two bones, oone lyke a knyse, the
other lyke a penne.’' The Sepia officinalis, which is found commonly on the coasts of
Britain, is not properly a flsh, but belongs to Cuvier's great division of Molluscous
animals, and the class of Ce'pkalopodes. Ang. Sax. cudele‚ sepia. See hemafter, co'rULL.

⁵ The primary meaning of the word cofyn seems to have been, as in Latin and French,
abasket, and is thus used in the Wieliffite version, which renders Matt. xiv. 20, “ Thei
token the relifis of broken gobetis, twelve cofyns sull.'‘ Elyot renders ‘⁴ Tibia, a
baskette or coffyn made of wyckers or bull rushes, or barke of a tree3 such oone was
Moyses put in to by the daughter of Pharao.’' The term also implied a raised crust, as
for a pie or a custard, and occurs in this sense in Shakespeare. See also the Forme of
Cury, pp. 72, 83, 89. Palsgrave gives ‘⁶ Coffyn, grant boiste.”
