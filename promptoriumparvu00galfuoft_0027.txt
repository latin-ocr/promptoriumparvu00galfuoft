The identity of the name Galfridus will, Ι think, scarcely dispose us to
accept the suggestion of the Bishop of St. Asaph as regards the marginal
scribbling which he noticcd in this Lincoln MS.; the name Starkcy, not
unknown in East Anglia, is more probably to be regarded as that of a
former possessor of the volume than that of the author. WVhatever may have
been his patronymic, I think that we may confidently ascribe to the Domi-
nican recluse of Lynn, Galsridus, designated, from 1115 special studies in an
age of very debased learning, “ Grammaticus‚’' the laborious achievement
of the first English-Latin and Latin—English Dictionaries. No doubt can,
I think, be entertained of his identity with the expounder of the “ Equi-
voca’' and the “ Synonyma ” of John de Garlandia, who is entitled “ Ma-
gister Galfridus Anglicus '' in the editions of those popular treatises printed
by Pynson and W. de Worde.

The author describes with simple earnestness in his Preambulum the
troubles of aspiring scholars, who, amidst the prevalent barbarism of his
times, thirsted for knowledge like harts for the water-brooks‚ and in vain
sought for guides, so that like wild asses they fainted in sobbing and sighs3
according to the lament of the prophet, the young children ask 1110011, and
no man breaketh it unto them ! He ‘⁴ drew up for their use,“ as expressed
by the Rev. J. E. B. Mayor, 10 1115 valuable Essays on early Lexicography,
“ a slight compendium, ⁴ opus exile,⁷ chiefly from the Catholicon‚ Campus
Florum, and Diccionarium. The most ignorant calumniator of the middle
ages could not speak of the poor 10011150 (⁴ sub regula paupertatis astric—

8 Bibl. Brit.-Hib. p. 305. The description of the Lincoln MS. given by the learned
bishop would lead us to conclude that 11 was a copy of the Promptorium, namely, an
English-Latin Dictionary. It is probable that Tanner had formed such a supposition
from the circumstance that in the colophon of Pynson’s edition of the Promptorium that
work is entitled “ Medulla Grammatice '' (see p. 539, infra), properly the designation of
the Latin-English Dictionary compiled possibly by the same author. The MS. noticed by
Tanner is still in the libr-ary, as before stated (see p. xvii„ note e); it is in fact a Latin-
English Dictionary3 at the end is written “Explicit Medulla Grammatiee.” The volume

contains also a “ Verbale‚'’ and the “ Liber Hymnorum cum expositione Galfridi ''men-
tioned by Tanner.
