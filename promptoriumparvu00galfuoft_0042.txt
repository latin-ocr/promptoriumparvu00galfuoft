xxxiv PREFACE.

library at worcester, where the author, who is said to have been an
intimate friend of Sylvester de Eveslmm, bishop of that see, and to have
died at the episcopal palace at Kenisey‚ was buried in the cloisters. His
mutilated effigy is still pointed out. This manuscript is now unsortunately
not to be found: there is a copy in the library at Caius College, Cam-
bridge, another at St. Peter's College in the same University 3⁸ and at Oxford
a valuable copy with a French gloss exists at St. John's College‚ MS.
No. clxxviii. 23.

The works enumerated in the foregoing list, as the principal authorities
consulted by the compiler of the Promptorium‚ were not, however, the only
sources from which the materials of his dictionary were derived. It may
be of some interest to collect the scattered notices that occur under various
words, since they indicate not only the grammatical or other treatises with
which the recluse friar of Lynn was conversam, but they may also serve
to shew the resources of conventual libraries in the fifteenth century. Mr.
Hingeston has pointed out, from the number of rare and valuable works
referred to in Capgrave's Chronicle, how extensive a store of learning must
have been treasured up in the library of the Austin Friars at Lynn‚ b and
it is probable that the library of the neighbouring convent of the Domini-
cans was not less copiously provided. The works of Aristotle are repeatedly
cited3 thus under the word ‘⁴ Dysowre,’' p. 122, is found “Bomoloclzusf Aris-
toteles in Ethieis;'‘ the same treatise is cited under “ Dullarde,” p. 135,
and, under ‘⁶ Deffe or dulle‚'‘ p. 116, reference occurs to Aristotle “in po-
liticis.’⁷ Under “ Telte,” p. 488, is found a reference to “ Egidius super
rhetoricam Aristotelis.” The “ Historia Scholastica,’' doubtless the po-
pular work of Peter Comestor, a celebrated theological writer of Troyes in
the twelfth century, is cited under “ Fyyr forke‚⁷' p. 161, and “ Prynce

‘⁴ Garbage of fowly53 emera, vel exta‚'' p. 186 (compare ΜΓ. lVright⁷s edition, p. 97);
“Jowpe‚ garment; jupa‚” p. 275 (lVrighn p. 9S); Latche or snekke3 pessula‚” p. 283
(compare VVrighn p. 110)3 “ Perre, drynke3 piretum,'' p. 394 (compare Wright, p. 98).

c The word in Harl. MS. 221is written Homolochus. Βωμόλοχος, a low jester, is a
word used by Aristotle‚ Ethics, N. 4, 8, 3, and also by Aristophanes. Compare Ortus
