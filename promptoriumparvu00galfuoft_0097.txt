bring under consideration. I may refer to his erudite account of Elyot,
Cooper, and Holyoke, by whom the rcvival of learning in the sixteenth
century was essentially aided in this country.³ To the “Copious Dic-
tionary '' of Francis Gouldman‚ however, published at a comparatively late
time, in 1664, and often cited in my notes, I would advert not merely as
combining the labors of his learned predecessors, of whom an ample notice
is set forth in the Prefaee, but as containing archaisms of interest to the
student of language, with certain expressions mostly of North-country
vernacular. To Dr. Jamieson's Dictionary of the Scottish Language I
have also often been indebted, and scarcely less frequently to the re-
searchcs of Brockett, of Hunter, and of others to whose timely care we owe
the preservation of many of the fast-fading traces of provincial dialectS.b

Whilst the foregoing pages were in the preSS, Sir Frederic Madden, to
whose friendly assistance I have frequently been indebted, has called
my attention to a writer who probably may have been the authority often
cited by the compiler of the Promptorium as “Mirivalensis in Campo
Florum,'’ and whom, as before stated, I have long in vain sought to
identify.

‘ Leland has given many particulars relating to “Thomas Guccllensz's,
a Leandro Alberto Bononiensi Thomas Αηῃῖἱοιιε de Malloise corrupte
³ “ Latin-English and English-Latin Lexieography‚'’ by the Rev. J. E. B. Mayor

(Librarian of the Public Library of the University of Cambridge), Journal of Ancient
and Saered Philology, vol. iv. 1857.

b Ι may refer to the Bibliographieal List of works illustrative of the Provincial Dialects

of England, by John Russell Smith‚ Lond. 1839, in which various volumes occasionally
cited in the notes and not enumerated above will be found. The numerous additions to

this class of philological literature render an enlarged edition of Mr. Russell Smith's
useful Hand-list very desirable.

c Probably for WValleis or Waleys, as he is sometimes called. Leland cites several of ·

his treatises on the authority of Leander Albertus, de Viris Illustr.‚ lib. iv. It may be
well to notice that there was a writer of an earlier period, Johannes Guallensis, a Fran-
eiscan of lVorcester, about 1260, of whose voluminous works see Bale, p. 317, Pits,
p. 3423 some confusion seems to have arisen in regard to his writings and those of
Thomas Guallensis. There was morcover another Thomas, professor of theology at
Oxford, in the time of Henry 111„ elected Bishop of St. David's in 1247.
