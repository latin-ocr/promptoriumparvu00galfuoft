(19.) Treatise by Walter de Bibelesworth.-—The early works compiled
to give instructions in French may be consulted with advantage, as throw-
ing light on archaisms occur-ring in the Promptorinm. Of this class of
grammatieal writings, eomparatively little known, may first be mentioned
the “ Doctrine‚'’ or ‘'‘ Treytyz ke moun sire Gauter de Bibelesworthe fist a
ma dame Dyonisie de Mounehensy pur api-ise de langwage.” Of this
eurious metrica] treatise, in Freneh verse with English glosses, I have
consulted a copy in Arundel MS. 2:20, and the little roll, Sloane MS.
8093* It has been edited by Mr. Thomas Wright from the Arundel MS.
with various readings from other copies, and may be found in his Voluine
of Vocabularies‚ printed in 1857 at the expense of Mr. Joseph Mayer.b

valuable copy formerly in the Heber Library is now in possession of Sir Thomas Phil-
lipps, Bart. Notices of the treatise by Bibelesworth may be found in M. Genin’s Preface
to the edition of Palsgrave's Esclarcissement de 13 langue Franqaise, Documents inedits

¹² I may here refer to an elementary treatise which I have not had the opportunity of
examiuing‚ preserved at Magdalen Collega, Oxford, No. 188, thus described by Mr.
Coxe: ‘⁵ Institutiones linguae Gallicanae cum onomastieo exemplisque Latina lingua
Anglieanaque editis. Incipit—Diecio gallica‚” &c. Catal. MSS. Bibl. S. M. Magd.
p. 86. Itis noticed at some length by M. Gemit, Introd. to Palsgrave's “Eselarcisse-
ment de la langue Franeoyse,'' reprinted in Coll. de Doe. Ined. Paris, 1852, p. 29. Α
similar work, supposed by the Abbb de la Rue to have been written temp. Edw. 1.‚ may
be seen in Harl. MS. 4971.
