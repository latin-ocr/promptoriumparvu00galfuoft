been selected for the groundwork of the present edition, as supplying the
earliest, most ample, and most correct text among the MSS. of the work
which have come under my observation. The original by the author's
hand has not been brought to light, and there are numerous indications of
alterations in spelling and other minutiae by the transcriber. The age of
the transcript, however, may entitle it to be considered as that which
most faithsully represents the original text3 it contains a much greater
number of words tl: an are found in any other MS. or in Pynson’s and sub-
sequent editions3 in addition to·this a synonym or explanatory phrase is
frequently found in the Harl. MS„ contributing to elucidate the significa-
tion of some archaisrn which in the other texts is comparatively obscure.

2. Fragment of a copy in Harl. MS. 2974, from which a few various
readings have been obtained3 they are in each instance indicated by the
number of the MS. It contains portions of the letters G. H. M. N. and
R.; and more nearly resemble-s the text of Pynson's printed edition than
any of ‘the other MSS. The termination of the verbs is written -ynge‚
as in Grawntynge, &c-

3. MS. preserved in the Library of King's College, Cambridge (class
mark, No. 8); a 111111 volume containing 75 leaves of parchment3 dimen-
sions 12 11101105 hy 8 11101105. The writing is in double columns, in a good
legible hand of the latter part of the fifteenth century, and very uniform
throughout the book. The initials at the beginning of each letter in the
alphabetical arrangement are painted with bright opaque blue, and have
rubricated marginal 110111151105, as shown in the facsimile. On the reverse
of the last leaf the donor is thus recorded, “Dedit Collegio Regali Sam.
Thomas ibidem Socius 16842’21 The name, probably, of a previous pos-
sessor is written on a ssy-leafat. the beginning, 6’(1)101)’1101κ1011,” and repeated
on the last leaf, in the same hand, ‘⁶ Rob't london nuper de Aldeby in Com.
Nor-ff. ar.⁷’b The names, “Thomas lVyndhamJ’ “Joh'es Buckenham,'' and
“ John Bayspoole‚'⁷ occur also in the volume.
