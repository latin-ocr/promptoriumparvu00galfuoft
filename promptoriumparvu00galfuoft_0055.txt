sion with which this is stated such can hardly be the case. He speaks of
Frederic and Peter as if both were of the family of Egmondt. (Typ. Ant. vol.
ii. Prelim. Obs. p. vii.) We find about the time in question a distinguished
person of that family, possibly the patron of Pynson, Frederic, son of
William IV. Count of Egmond. In 1472 he received from his uncle the
Duke of Gueldres the lordship of Buren, he was named governor of Utrecht
by the Archduke Maximilian in 14923 two years later Buren was raised
to a County in reward of his service53 he died in 1500.α Ι have, however,
sought in vain to trace a connection between this personage and England3
we learn from Pontanus that he was educated at the University of Paris,
and it may therefore be presumed that he retained some taste sor literature.
There was a Peter, an illegitimate brother of his father, who might have
been living at that time3 what was his surname does not appear. Had
these persons, however, been Pynson's patrous on this occasion, the nobility
of the former would surely have been in some way mentioned, instead of
the word “ virtuosi ” being applied to both. It may be more probable that
these patrons were either merchants or booksellers3 in the latter case the
work must have been printed for them as a trade speculation. Panzer, in
his Annales Typographici, has perhaps somewhat too hastily placed the
names of Frederic Egmondt and Peter Post pascha in one of his lists of
printers (that arranged by their Christian names), probably on the autho-
rity of this colophon, as no other mention of either is known in connection
with typography except that, as I have been informed by Mr. Winter J ones,
a Frederic de Egmont appears in the colophon of a Sarum missal printed
at Venice in 1494, “jussu et impensis praestantissimorum virorum Friderici
de Eglnont ac Gerrardi Barrevelt: impressum per J oannem de Hertzog de
Landoia.” (Panzer, vol. iii. p. 358.) Mr. Winter J ones considers that the
designations virtuosus, proestantissimzcs, and the like, do not indicate persons
of high rank.
