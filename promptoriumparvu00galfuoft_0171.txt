“ And in his owen chambre hem made a bedde
With shetes and with chalons faire yspredde.'’

'l'yrwhitt thinks they were probably so called from having been made at Chalons. ‘⁶ A
chalone, amplcitapetztm!’ CATH. ANGL. In an Inventory taken at the Hospital of
St. Edmund‚ Gateshead‚ 1325, there occurs, “ In Chore, Unum fi'ontale cle Chalonns.''

¹ “Chape of a knyfe, 2¹071wll·2cs.'' cun. ANGL. “ Chape of a shethe, bonterolle de
yayne. To chape a swerd or dagger.'' PALSG. The word is derived from the French
chappe, which Cotgrave explains to be “the loeket of a scabbard,” but Skinner more
correctly ‘¹ vuffl'nae mum-o ferreus.” The chape of a sword was a badge assumed by the
De 13 Warr family, in memorial of the part taken by Sir Roger de la XVarr, at Poitiers‚
1356, in the capture of John King of France, when he took possession of the royal
sword.

⁴ The term chare seems to have been the earliest appellation in England of vehicles
used to eonvey persons of distinction. It has been derived from the Anglo-Saxon cyran,
vei-term but probably we derived both the vehicle and its appellation from France‚
where, as early as 1294, the use of the ςῘιαν had become so prevalent that it was for-
bidden to the wives of citizens by an ordinance of Philippe le Bel. A description of
the rich chare prepared for the Princess of Hungary will be found in the Squyr of low
degree, Ellis's δρα-11118115, vol. i.‚ aud is beautifully illustrated by an illumination in
the Louterell Psalter, executed in the reign of Edward ΙΙ. See Mr. Rokewode's valuable
paper in the Vetusta Mon. vol. vi. plate xx. A variety of representations are also
given by Mr. Markland, with his remarks on the early use of carriages in England,
Archaeol. xx. 443. The appellation chare continued in use in the XVIth century.
Horman says, “ The quyene came in a chare, pilento. He came in a chare or a wagen.''
It occurs in Hall and Fabyan ς and in Strype’s Memoirs‚ Edward VI. 1557, is mentioned
a ‘⁶ chair drawn by six chariot horses.”
