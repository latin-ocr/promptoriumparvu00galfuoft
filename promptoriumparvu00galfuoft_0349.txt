¹ The art of working in horn was one in which the English were formerly much skilled.
In 1464 the horners presented a petition to Parliament against strangers, who came “ to
understond the konnyng and feate of makyng of horns.'' Rot. Parl. iv. 567. “ Homer,

² ‘⁴ Hornkecke‚ a fysshe lyke a mackerell.'' PALSG. Esox belone, Linn. Aug-sax. horn,
cornu, and ceac, yeiza. See GARFrsan.

³ Chaucer. in the Rom. of R. speaks of the discordant sounds of “ hornepipes of Corne-
waile,'' which, as it has been remarked in the note on the word CORMUSE, seem to have
been identical with that instrument, called likewise‚ according to Roquefort, muse, in
Latin musa. The rustic dance, to which the name of hornpipe was transferred from the
instrument that served as an accompaniment, seems to be described by Jean de Meung,
where he relates that Pygmalion took the “ inse-amem de Cb7·7touaille,'' or “ muse,'' and
danced to animate his statue. Rom. de la Rose, 21‚874. The horn-pipe is mentioned as
a musical instrument by Spenser and B. Jonson. No explanation has been found of the
word palpista.

⁵ The horse-litter, or horse—bere, Ang.-Sax. baere, feretrum, muluatus, was used at an
early period in England, and probably introduced from the South. See Mr. Markland’s
Remarks on Carriages, Archaeol. xx. 445. Bede relatcs that Ceolfrid, Abbot of Wire-
muth, pursued his journey to Rome, during which he died, A.D. 716, “cum ad Ιιοσ per
infirmitatem deveniret, ut equitare non, valens feretro caballario vehereturst W. Malmsb.
relates that the corpse of Rufus was conveyed by the rustics to winchester “in rlzeclti
caballaria,” which in the Polychronicon is termed a “horse bere‚'' and by Fabian a
“ horse litter.” M. YVestm. describes the retreat of King John from Swineshead, when,
having lost his “ δέρας, et quasdam clitellas,'' in the lVash, and falling sick, he was thus
carried to Newark, “facici lectica equestri, descendit de palfrido, et ipsam intravit'* G.
de Bibelesworth, who wrote in the reign of Edw. Ι. says,

“ Pm· eyse en litier (on hors bere) hom olitanae-lae?

arceroe or lectiae, carried by two horses, according to the fashion in use in Holland, are
represented in the Orbis Sensualium, p. 111, ed. 1659.
