1 Skinner suggests that pageant may be derived from the Greek πάγω, πῆγμα, οι·
“ Belg. XVaeghen, currus, q. d. currus pompaticusst Tooke considers it to be the
pres. part. paeceand, of the Ang.-Sax. verb paecan, decipere, to illude by simulated re-
presentations. The primary signification of the word appears to have been a stage or
scaffold, which was called paqz'na, it may be supposed, from its construction, being a
machine eom22ayinata‚ framed and compacted together. The curious extracts from the
Coventry records given by Mr. Sharp, in his Dissertation on the Pageants or Mysteries
performed there, afford definite information on this subject. The term is variously
written, and occasionally “ pagyn‚ pagen,” approaching closely to the Latin paqz'na.
The various plays or pageants composing the Chester mysteries, each of which is ap-
propriated to one of the trades, are entitled‚ ‘⁶ Payina prima, de celi, anqelorum, δῖε.

&a The drapers’ playe ;'’ and so forth. See Chester Plays, Wright's edition from
Add. MS. 10,305. A curious contemporary account has been preserved of the con-
struction of the pageants at chester during the XVIth cent. ‘⁴ which pagiants weare a
high scafold with ⁶2 rowmeS, a higher and a lower, upon 4 wheeles.'' Sharp, Cov.
Myst. p. 17, The term denoting the stage whereon the play was exhibited subse-
quently denoted also the play itself; but the primary sense, clearly defined by the
Coventry documents, is observed by several writers, as by Higins, in his version of
Junius's Nomenclator, 1585. “Peqma, tiynea machina in altum educta, tabulatis
etiam in sublime crescentibus eompaqz'nata, deloco in locum portatilis, aut quse vehi
potest, ut in pompis fieri solet: Eschaffaut, a pageant‚ or scaffold.'' “Peyma est
machina super quam statue ponu7ztur.” oR'rus. ‘⁴ A paiande, lusorium.” οΑΤΗ. ANG.
“Pagiant in a playe, mystereff’ PALSG. ‘⁴ Fere-ulex, the thing whereon images or
Pageants are carried; also beers for dead men. Peymate, a stage or frame, whereon
Pageants be set or carried.'’ coro. Horman says, ‘⁴ There were v. coursis in the feest,
and as many paiantis in the pley. 1 wyll haue made v. stag3 (sic) or bouthis in this playe
(scenas.) Ι wolde haue a place in the middyl of the pley (orchestra), that 1 myght se
euery paiaunt. Of all the crafty and subtyle paiantis and pecis of warke made by
mannys wyt, to go or moue by them selfe, the clocke is one of the beste.'’ In this
passage the term seems to be taken as denoting stage machinery. Of the gorgeous
pageants set up by the citizens of London on occasions such as the reeeption of the
Emperor Charles V. 1522, detailed descriptions have been preserved by Hall, the
Chronicler. See ou this subject Collier’s Hist. of Dram. Poetry, ii. 151, and the
Appendix to Davies’s Muuicipal Records of York, 8νο. 1843.
