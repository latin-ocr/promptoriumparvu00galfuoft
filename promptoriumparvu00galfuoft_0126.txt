2 The ornaments of the girdle, which frequently were of the richest description, were

termed barres, and in French elom&

they were perforated to allow the tongue of the

buckle to pass through them, Originally the)v were attached transversely to the wide
tissue of which the girdle was formed, but subsequently were round or square, or fa-
shioned like the heads of lions, and similar devices‚ the name of barre being still re—
tained, though improperly. Thus a citizen of Bristol bequeathed in 1430, “zonam

llarnisatam cvm barris (zrgys'tztc' rotundis.”

In the description of the girdle of Riehesse,
in Chaucer's Romaunt of the Rose, we read,

“ The barris were of gold full fine

Upon a tissue of sattiu,

Full hevie, grete and nothing light,
In everiche was a besaunt wight.·'

In the original, “les clovx furem d'or epurb.” The word was similarly applied to
the ornaments of other parts of costume, such as the garter, worn by the Knight of the
Order, or spur-leathers, as in Gawayn and the Green Kny3t, i. 287.
