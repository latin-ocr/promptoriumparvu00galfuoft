latchets, and worn by men as early as the time of Edw. III. Allusion is made to it by

Chaucer,
“ Ne were worthy to unbocle his galoche.” squire’s Tale, 10‚869.

In the inventory of the effects of Henry V. taken A.D. 1423, mention occurs of “jpez'r
(le yalayes filit: d‘estreyn, iz· d. ‚· '³ but it is not easy to understand how straw should be
a proper material for the purpose. See Rot. Parl. IV. 329. In Sir John Howard's
Household Book, A.D. 1465, p. 314, are named both galaches and pynsons, which
last are in the Promptorium explained to be socks. See Household Expenses in England.
This kind of shoe was occasionally an article of luxury and ostentatious display, which
probably suggested the allusion that occurs in the Vision of Piers Ploughman, where one
is described as coming eagerly, as if to be dubbed a knight‚

“ To geten hym gilte spores. ‚
Or galoches y-couped.''’ line 12‚O99.

The term “ y-couped '⁹ seems to imply the extravagant fashion of the Iong-peaked toe :
‘⁴ illimus, a coppid sh00.” ORTcs. In the reign of Edward IV. a statute was passed, by
which the higher classes alone were permitted to wear shoes, “yaloyes‚” or boots, with a
peak longer than 2 inches (Rot. Parl. v. 505, 5663 Stat. of Realm, 11. 415); but, from
certain allusions in ancient romanoe, it would seem that the fashion was, by the usage of
a much earlier period, permitted to none under the degree of a knight. See Sir Degom,
700; Torrent of Portugal, 1193, διο. The ourious drawings in Cott. MS. Julius, E. lv.
(t. Hen. VI.)‚ one of which, representing King John, has been given in Shaw's Dresses‚
exhibit the galaehe in its most extravagant form. “ Solea, a shoe called a galage or
paten, whiche hathe nothynge on the sete, but onely lachettes.” ELYOT. ‘⁴ Gallozm,
a kind of wooden patins, startops, gallages, or stilts. Cospi, wooden pattins, or pan-
tofies‚ shoes with wooden soles, startops or galages‚'’ διο. FLOR10. “ Galoche, a
woodden shoe or patten made all of a peece, without any latchet or ty of leather, and
worne by the poore clowne in winter.'' COTG. See Spenser‚ Sheph. Cal. Febr. and
Sept. In the Wardrobe Book of Prince Henry, A.D. 1607, are mentioned “ 1 pair of
golossianS, 63. 16 gold buckles with pendants and toungs to buckle a pair os golosses.''
Archaeol. xi. 93.
