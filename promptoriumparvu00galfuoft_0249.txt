¹ Compare Row eLo'rHE‚ as faldynge and other lyke, which occurs hereafter. The
term fafflyng, signifying a kind of frieze, or rough-napped eloth, is derived by Skinner
from Ang. Sax. feald, plica. because coarse wrappers or mantles were usually made of
it. Chaucer describes the West Country shipman as clad

“ In a goune of falding to the knee.'' Cant. Tales, Prol.
Nichola.s‚ the Oxford clerk, had his books, and appliances of science,

‘¹ On shelues all couched at his bed's hed;
His presse icouered with a faldyng red,
And all aboue there lay a gay Sautrie.” Miller's Tale.

Nich. de Schirburn‚ an ecclesiastic of York, bequeathed‚ in 1392, “tunicam dc nisyro
faldyng lineatam ,· '’ and Ric. Bridesall, merchant of the same city, makes this devise;
‘⁶ layo patri meo meam armilausmn, videlicet faldyng clok.'' Testam. Ebor. i. 173, 171.
“Amphibalus‚ a sclaveyn, a faldynge or a dudd.’' ΜΕῑ), GRAMM. “A faldynge,
amphibalus. A faldynge, plicacio, convolzwio‚” CATH. ANG. This kind of eloth was
supplied, probably, from the North of Europe, and identical with the woollen wrappers
of which Hermoldus speaks, “quos non appellamus Ειιίιίοηεε ,· '' Chron. Slav. i. c. 1 3
called by Adam Bremensis “ Paldones.” F rieze received its name from Friesland, and
the rough garments of that country are called by Andrew Borde “ dagswaymsss’ as has
been noticed above in the note on that word¹ The Polonie of Scotland may have
received its name from its Polish origin; see the curious observations on that word in
the Supplement to Jamieson’s Dietionary. These garments, as also the Irish mantles,
much in request so late as the reign of Charles 1. as appears by the Custom-house
rates, were, probably, the same as the faldyng3 the last were usually imported in pairs,
upon which the duty, as rated in 1553, was 53. and by the Kytson Household Book it
appears that in 1573 the price of “a coople of Irish mantells'' was 43s. History
of Hengrave. “Endromis, vestis villosa cle «rimis pellibus suem, vel pallium forle
η ‘willemum (stc. an yrysshe mantell.’' ORTUS. “Bi-acccc, that kyndc of a mantell whiche
nowe commetlr out of Ireland, οι· a longe garment made of roughe frise.” ELYOT, 1542.
Fallin signifies in Irish‚ according to Lluyd, a mantle, and the term appears to be iden-
tical with that used by Giraldus Camb. in his description of the Irish, composed in
1185; “caputiis marla-is assumti susat ct arctis, crates lmneros (leof-snm, cubito temes
protensis, . . . . sul) quibas plmlz'nya‘s lastels quoque, palliorum vice, utuntur-fl Topog.
11it›ern.l.iii. c. 10. The fashion of the plenalinyzcs is exhibited iu marginal drawings
in a·valuable contemporary MS. of Girafflus, in the possession of Sir Thomas Phillipps;
and it is described by the appella-tion eor-cula in the Life of St. Cadoc, MS. Laudav-
Eccl. as cited by Spelxnan, under that word. See further Tymvhitt's Chaucer, aud
Ledwich's Antiquities of lreland, 2⁴37.
