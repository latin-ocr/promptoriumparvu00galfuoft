as has been noticed in the Preface, p. xxxiv. note c. Aristotle repeatedly uses the
word Βωμὸλοχυς, a low jester. Thus likewise I find in the Ortus “Bomolochus, i.
scurra (a brawler); Eomolochia‚ i. scurrilitas.’'

Page 125, note 3. The conjecture that the reading of the Harl. MS. (Doroi‘i') is corrupt,
and suggesting “ dogon '⁹ as a correction, has been confirmed by collation of MS. A,
with which the editor had not been acquainted. The reading there found is “ Doion',
Dogena;'' of this Latin word the signification has been sought in vain. Dugon
(Jamieson), dudgeon, dungeon (N. country), dogone, A. N„ seem to have been
ternis of contempt. See Wrigbt’s Dict. of Obsolete and Provincia! Words. “ Dungy,
cowardly‚” Wilts. M. de Haan Hettema, in his list of Archaic words compared
with Frisian and Dutch, gives “Dogone, a term of contempt. F. dogeniet, D.
deugniet, nequam.” Trans. Philol. Soc. 1858, p. 153.

“ Think“st thou my spirit shall keep the pack-horse way,
That every dudgeon low invention goes ?”—Drayton.

Nares cites many authorities, from which it would seem that “Dudgeon⁷’ was a
mottled or hard wood for hasting daggers, to which allusion is made by Shakespeare.
It was likewise used for drinking bowls, or maserS. Compare Ronnyn as dojoun or
masere, p. 436 b. supra. Amongst gifts to St. Alban’s Abbey we find “ ciphum de
dugun ornatum argento cum cooperculo de eodem ligno.” Cott. MS. Nero D. vn.

lt has been suggested that in these words the s should have been printed f. Pro-
bably the author wrote “ wrout, dowty, dowtyr;” a copyer may have supplied the
guttura] by an f, which was possibly mistaken for an s. It deserves notice that gh
is not unfrequently, especially in the Eastern counties, pronounced like f, asin cougb,
laugh‚ trough, διο. and thus also in the name Rougham in Suffolk.
