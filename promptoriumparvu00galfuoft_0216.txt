¹ The derivation of this word appears, according to Skinner and J unius, to be from
Ang. Sax. dwaes, hebes, stultam the Teut. daesen, insanire, phantasmate turbari is
more closely assimilated to it. In the Wicliffite version Gen. xxvii. 1 is rendered
thus: “Foresothe Isaac wax eld, and hise 3en dasewiden.'' The word is repeatedly
used by Chaucer.

vol. lviii. 524.

⁴ “To dawe, (liare, diescere, eliel, z'1npcrsonale.“’ CATH. ΔΝΜ.. This verb is used
by Chaucer:

“ Thus laboureth be, till that the day gan dawe.’⁷ Marchant’s Tale.
