in the version of Glanvile de Propriet. Rerum, attributed to Trevisa, lib. xvii. c. 97.
Flax, it is stated, after being steeped and dried, is “bounde in praty nytches and
boumlels‚ and afterward knocked, beaten and brayed, and carfled, rodded and gnodded‚
ribbed and hekled, and at the last sponne.'' Rippliug flax, the North Country term, is
possibly synonymous with ribbing. See Ray, N. Country Words, and Broekett‚ who

Kennett also notices it thus‚-“ To ripple flax, to wipe off the seed vessels, Bor. Rather
to repple flax with a repple or stick. A. s. repen, baculus. Rippo, or repple, a long
walking-staff carried by countrymen. Cheshi1·e.'' In an Inventory (taken at North-

wool eames, v. d.” Wills and Invent. Surtees Soc. vol. i. p. 104. See RYPELYNGE of
flax, infra.

³ This part of the appliances of a spinner is doubtless what is now called in Norfolk
‘⁶ a Tripskin,—a piece ot leather, worn on the right-hand side of the petticoat by spinners
with the rock, on which the spindle plays and the yarn is pressed by the hand of the
spinner.’' FORBY. “ A rybbynge skyne, nebrida,pellicnclia.'’ CATH. ANG. “ Pellieuch'a,
