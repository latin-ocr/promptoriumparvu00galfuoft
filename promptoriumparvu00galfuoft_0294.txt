burde lyme melteth a swelled milt, if it be sodden, and layd to wyth a gete stone, or the
Asiane stone.” Beads, used for the repetition of prayers, were frequently formed of this
material ς thus among the gifts of Philip le Hardi to his daughter, on her marriage with
the King of Bohemia. A.D. 1393. occurs, “Item. j palernoxtres cle perles et de jayet,
on il „²1 a καπρίῳ-ωερε perles, et ix ensec'ynanlx ‹Z'or.’' Hist. de Bourg. iii. Alianor Duchess
of Gloucester bequeaths A.D. 1399, ‘¹ un pare sle patei-nostres (Fore, cont' ’.κίε aviae, et
iiej gande-s (le yet, qe fuerent ὰ mon seiynour ec onari.’' Royal Wills. See also Testam.
Ebor. i. 381. There is evidence that by some persons such beads were superstitiously
regarded as gifted with extraordinary virtue; and to this belief Bp. Bale appears to make
allusion, Kynge Johan, p. 39.

‘⁵ Holy water and bredde shall dryve awaye the devyll;
Blessynges with blaeke bedes wyll helpe in every evyll.’‘

¹ Palsgrave gives “ Gettar, a braggar,frinyuereau. Iettar‚ a facer, fecem} braffyarl,
Ietmr of nyght see-son, Ζη-ίζ]ῑ·εῑιν;” and Cotgrave, ‘⁶ Frinyuereaa, a letter. spruee mini0n‚
gay fellow, compl: youth.'’ Compare hereafter SCHAKERE, or gettare: lascivus.

² This term denotes the singular projection of the solars 01· upper stories in old timbered
houses, of which most picturesque specimens are still seen at Chester, and other towns.
“Procnes dicuntur capita trabium que eminent extra parietes. Heclem (licitur sola-
rc‘nm dependens parietibus cenacvlz'.'' ORTUS. The Catholioon explains menusanum
to be the same as solarium, so named from Menianus, who made in the Forum
certain convenient places for beholding public spectacles. “AIenianu, buildings out-
ward in prospectes and galeries. especially when they be so builded that the edifiee
iutteth out in length from the piller or other part' of the house, wherin the building
especially resteth3 buildings of pleasure hanging and iutting out.’' COOPER. Horman
says that “ buyldynge chargydde with iotyes (moeniona seclzsn'cz'a) is parellous whan it is
very ol‹le.'' In Macbetb, act Ι. sc. vi. Shakespeare makes use of the term “jutty'’
in this sense. where Banquo commends the position of Macheth’s castle. Florio, in his
Ital. Dict. 1598, gives ‘¹ Barbacane, an outnooke‚ or corner standing out of almuse, a
jettie. Sporro‚a porc-h, bay-window, or out-butting‚ or jettie of a house, that jetties
out further than anie other part os the housoss' Cotgrave renders “sm'pemlue, a iettie,
an ontiutting roome. Smapemlne, sonpente⁷‚ a pent<house, iuttie, or part of 3 building
that iuttieth or leaneth ouer the rest.” Steevens cites an agreement made by P. Hens-
lowe for building a theatre in 1599, with “ ajuttey forwards in eyther of the two upper
stoi-ies '⁹

⁴¹ Festus and Papias state that certain monstrous images that were exhibited in the
games of the circus, or on the stage, were termed by the Romans manduci. Cooper
