I. MEDULLA GRAMMATICE on Gnfflmwcaa-This is the earliest Latin-
English Dictionary known to me, and it is supposed to have been compiled
by the author of the Promptorium. On this account, and also in con-
sideration of its value to the student of the language of the period, I
have thought it desirable to give a somewhat detailed description of the
MSS. that I have been able to discover, all of them being of the later
half of the fifteenth century, and including those in which, as previously
stated, very great modifications of the text will be found, although, as on
careful examination Ι hare been led to suppose, they are substai‘itially
identical with the Medulla and may properly be classed with it. See
p. xxii.

1. Ι have not met with any copy of earlier date than a MS. in my
own possession, obtained about 1841 from the late ΜΓ. Rodd. It is a
small folio, containing 116 leaves of parchment, written in double columns
very legibly by two different hands3 the initials are rulss›1·icated. There
is aprol‹1›gue commeucin g thus :-“ Hec cst regula generalis pro toto libro.
Omnia nomina, verbalia, et participia habent significatirmem verborum a
quibus descendunt secundum eorum formam et anologiam, &te-Fructum
gramatice pueris do sub brevitate. Incipit liber intitulatus Medulla
gramatice. The dictionary then begins with—‘⁶ Alma . i . virgo abscondita
vel absconsio virginitatis,'' and concludes—‘⁴ Zonigogo, as, to gyrd vp.—
Explicit Medulla Gramatice.⁷⁷ The date of this MS„ which is in excellent
preservationi and in the original wooden boards covered with leather, may
be about 1460.ἃ

hand contemporary with the MS„ ‘⁶ Brother Wylliam Bai-ker I pray youe leit thys booke
