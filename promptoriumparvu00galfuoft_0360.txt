Nares quotes Spenser, and other writers, by whom the word is used, and thinks it may
be derived from Fr. jzwelle, a brush-wood faggot, a name that might be applied to such
fellows as Shakespeare calls “ rash bavin wits.” Holland, in his version of Pliny. speaks
of the “javels,'' stalks, or stems of line or flax. B. xiX. c. 1. See further observations
in Jamieson. Compare iorrss, or folte, Joppus, and IAPER, Germ.

¹ Jesses or gesses, used in falconm are thus defined by Nicot: ‘⁴ θεοῖς (qais, or
yios) sont clem: polites com'roics com-tes (le pean (le chien, une en claraque jambe du fimlcon
pres ίαν serre,- ιιῑι (lessus ‹Iesqzzels sont les sonnettes tanaus ὰ une autre petiie courroye
ὰ part.'' Latham says that “ Jesses are those short straps of leather which are fastened
to the hawks legges, and so to the Lease by Varvels, Anlets, or such like.'' The origin
of the term is evident, as signified by the Emperor Fred. II. in his treatise [Ze arce
Venandz’, ii. o. 38; namely‚ ‘⁸ ob hoc jacti dicuntur, quod cum eis jaciuntur falcones, et
emittuntur ad proedam.” They are also called Gelli. See Ducange and Menage. In
‘⁴ Dame Julyan Bernes Proeesse of hawkyng” it is stated that ‘⁶ Hawkys have abowte
theyr leggys gesses made of leddyr moost comynly‚ some of sylke, whyehe scholde be noo
lenger but that the knottys of theym sholde appere in myddys of the left honde, bytwene
the longe fyngre and the leche syngre3 by cause the Levmes sholde be fastenyd to theym

² This word does not appear to be retained in the East Anglian dialect. Tusser uses
it both in the sense of strutting about ostentationsly, and of aetively busying oneself, or
bustling to and fro. In the interesting account of his own life, be says that his desire
was ease and contemment, and to live uprightly,

‘⁶ More than to ride with pomp and pride,
Or for to jet in others debt.¹' Stanza 38.

In his Epistle to the Lady Paget, prefixed to his Book of Huswifery, among the quali-
ties of a good housewife, he says that she “should jetty from morning to night.’'
Palsgrave gives the following illustratione of the use of this word: “ I iette, I make a
countenaunee with my legges‚ie me imnboye. 1 wotte nat what his herte is, but he
ietleth horriblye in his paee. Ι lette πῖ faeyon and eountenaunee to set forthe myselfe,
ie Zougfyue. I get, I use a proude countenaunee and pace in my goyng. Se I praye the

universyte to go a iettynge a nyghtes? le baille lon pere exlcz'bz'cion ὰ Γαηίύενείίέ pom·
aller rander? '³ Cotgrave gives ‘⁴ Bam-e les rues, to iet, reuell, or swagger vp and down
the streets in the night. Imnboyer, to iet, or wantonly to go in and out with the legs.
Frz'wyzzer, to iet or brave it, to be fine, spruce‚ trimme, to wantonise it‚” &c. Anchoran
