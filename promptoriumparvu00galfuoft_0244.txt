or recluses, were a numerous class in England3 many curious particulars regarding
them have been brought together by Fosbroke, in his British Monachism, p. 503. The
essential difference between the hermit and the ANKYR, or recluse, the terms oceurring in
the Promptorium, appears to be defined by Giraldus in his epistle to Abp. Langton,
where he makes use of the following expression: “Hm-emim> solivagi—Anaclwritae
conclusi.'’ Ang. Sacra, ii„ 436. They had both, however, a fixed dwelling-place, al-
though differing in certain conditions; the establishment of an hermitage was among
those acts which in former times served to testify‚ in a signal manner‚0f the piety of
the founder, or his gratitude for divine protection. Thus it appears by Pat. 1 Hen. IV.

been seated on the throne, oue of the first acts of that sovereign was the precept ‘⁴ de
heremitaffl'o oeclg'sifflndo apud quendam locum vocatam Ram«mesco-osboume‚ in quo Rex
‘ultimo suo adventu c1p2)licnlt.'’ A curious evidence of the high respect and estimation
in which reeluses and hermits were held at this period, is afforded by the will of Henry,
Lord de Scrop, A.D. 1415, whose bequests in their favour are singularly numerous and
detailed. Rymer, ix.‚ 275.

ment of the sailor.

In Piers Ploughman’s Vision it is used to signify the flow of water, or running of tears.

“ And then welled water for wicked workes,
Egrely ernyng out of men’s eyen.'’ Passus 20.

Laneham, in his curious account of the reception of Elizabeth at Kenilworth Castle, in
1575, uses the word in deseribing the eager course of the stag-hound3 “ the earuing of
