¹ The term fiash, signifying a shallow pool, does not appear to be now retained in
Norfolk; but it occurs in names of places, as Flash.pit‚ near Aylsham. In low-Latin
fl(1(·lcz'1.z‚fl‹zsc‹⁷„ and ἥψαο, in old Freneh flach& or flrsque, have the like signification. A
supply of water from the looks on the Thames. to assist the barges, is termed a flash,
and in Sussex loose water—soaked ground is called flashy. Plot speaks of the “flashy
over-watery taste '' of some white fruits. Hist. Oxf. 156. See PLASCHE, or flasche where
reyne watyi· stondythe, and PYT, or fiasche.

² This word, placed here out of its proper alphabetioal order, whereas PLAGGE of be
erthe has occurred already, has been retained as found in the MS„ on account of the
uncertainty whether it is an interpolation, ora vitiated reading. Possibly the correct
reading may be flawe, a term synonymous with flagge, a sod of turf. Blount, in his
Law Dict. v. Turbary, cites a chal-ter in which ‘⁶ turharia larnaria—a flaw-turf‚ or heath-
turf‚'' is mentioned. Iu the North the words flaw and flaughter are still commonly used
in this sense. See Jamieson and Brockett.

³ “ A flawne, opacnms' cA‘ffl. ANG. “Flatmz, a flawne. Artocira, a flawne, i.
cibus factus ex posui et caseo. Layamm est latus panis et tenuis oleo linitus, quasi
olco frixas, a paneake, a flawne.” ORTUS. “Flaune meate, flavet, flamfiaon. Ι Ioue
wella flawneq but and it be well sugred I loue it the better.'' PALSG. Caxton says in
the Boke sor Tramllers, “Of mylke and of egges men make flawnes (flans), of mylke
soden with the flour men make printed cakes (mstons).'' Recipes for making flawnes
will be found in the For1ne of Cury3 “Flawnes for Lentynff' Harl. MS. 5401, f. 193,
2‹›2; and ‘⁶ flathonss' under the head of “ Vgsccamle farm-”ff Harl. MS. 279, f. 42, b.
The following directions “¹ for flaunes '' are found iu the poem entitled “ the sly3tes of
cure.''

‘⁶ Take new chaee, and grynde hyt fayre
In morter wyth egges, wyth out (lyswayre 3
Put powder berto of suger I say,
Coloure hyt wyth safrone ful wele bou may3
Put hyt in eofyns bat bene fayre.
And bake hyt forthe y the pray.'’ Sloane MS. 1986, f. 87.

In the North the word is still in use, as Bp. Kennett notioed in his glossarial collections,
Lansd. MS. 1033. “ Flaun or flawn, a eustard. Bor. As flat as a flawn. proverb. Sax.

⁴ This must not be eonfounded with the general appellation of flat fish; the ray or
scate was formerly called ῈιΑΤΗΕ, or, according to Willughby and Ray, flaire, still
retained in the name of the sting-ray, called in some places the fire-flaire. In North
Britain it is known as the fire-tlaw, according to Jamieson. Harrison, in his description
of England, uses the name flath, evidently as (lenoting the ray or soate. In the account
