in the Archaeologia‚ xvii. pl. 23. A lectern of marble, resembling such as is quarried
in Derbyshire, exists at Crowle in W⁷orcestershire3 it appears to be a work of the XIIth
century. Another beautifully-sculptured specimen is preserved in the ancient abbatial
house at WVenlock, Salop. In the former instance alone, the arrangement whereby the
desk was supported on small columns may be ascertained. Of the moveable lecterns of
a later period, numerous specimens have escaped the ravages of the XVIth and XVIIth
eenturies. Carved lecterns of wood exist at Bury, Huntingdonshire, date about 1300;
at Ramsey ; Swanscombe and Lenham in Kent3 Hawsted in Suffolk 3 and in many other
churches. Those of brass are mostly of the XVth century, or later date. At Rouen
Cathedral an ancient lectern of iron may be seen, which, being hinged together like a
fizldc'storz'mn, and furnished with a socket for a candle on one side, might be folded up
when not in use, and laid asffle, so as not to encumher the area of the choir. The lectern
was adorned with a covering, frequently termed the ‘⁴ des-cloth,” of rich material eon-
forma'ole to the suit, or complete vestment, of which it formed a part. In the Inventory
of the Church of St. Faith, in the crypt at St. Paul‘s, 1298, is mentioned “ pannus cle pal

¹ The etymology and precise meaning of this word are exceedingly obscure 3 it is used
by Chaucer in the tale of the Cambridge scholars who came to the Miller of Trunipington
to have their grain ground, and left their horse under a pent-house or outbuilding, instead

of putting him into the ‘⁶ lathe 3⁸⁹ the nnller, to play them a shrewd trick, slipped off the
bridle, and let the horse run.

“ He looked up and doune, till he had yfound
The clerkes horse, there as he stood ybound‚
Behind the mill, under a lessel.” Reve’s Tale, 4059.

Tyrwhitt prints the word “levesell‚'' and its meaning here is less obscure than in a
passage in the Persone's Tale, where it again occurs. chauoer defines the difference
between pride in the beart of man, and pride shown in external show and costly array :
“But nathelesse, that one of these spices of pride is signe of that other, right as the
gaye leuesell at the taverne is signe of the wine that is in the seller.” Speght‚ who had
herc consulted the Promptorium, explains the word as signifying a busli, or a hovel,
which is repeated by Skinner, with the suggestion that it may be derived from the
French ‘⁴ lctis, vepres, virgsvlta, addita term. clim. ell.” This derivation seems little
to the purpose. According to Cotgrave lais, or layes, are trees left as marks in cutting
a eopse wood. Tyrwhitt in liis notes says confidently that the word is derived from
