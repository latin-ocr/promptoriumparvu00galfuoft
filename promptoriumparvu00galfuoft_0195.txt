¹ In N. Britain atemporary building or shed is called a corf, or corf-house, signi-
fying, as J amieson observes, a hole or hiding place, Ang. Sax. cruft, crypta, or perhaps
approaching most nearly to Isl. korbae, tuquriolum. The floating basket used on the
Suffolk coast to keep lobstem, is called, as Forby states, a corf or coy3 and it seems
possible that this appellation may have been given to the shepherd's hut, from its being
formed with wattles, like a rudely-fashioned basket. Caxton, in the Boke for Tra-

vellem, calls a basket a “ corffe, or mande.''
² A distinction seems to be made in the Promptorium between the CORMUSE and

the moos—prpe, pandat-(z, a word which has occurred previously. Chaucer speaks
of the great multitude that he saw in the House of Fame,

“ That made Ioud Minstralcies
In cornmuse and shalmies.'' Book iii.

In the Romance of the Rose he describes the discordant sounds produced by Wicked
Tongue “with hornepipes of cornewaile‚” evidently identical with the cornmuse.
Palsgrave renders “Bagge-pype‚ coz-nemuse‚’' in low Latin, “comemusa, vost: ab
Italis et Hispanis usurpata, uter symphoniacm.” DUC. Hawkins has given in the
nist. of Music, vol. ii. 453, a representation of the coi-namus« or bagpipe, copied from
the Musurgia of Luscinius, published at Strasburg, 1536. Dr. Burney observes that
“the cornmuse was the name of a horn or Cornish pipe, blown like our bagpipe.”
vol. ii. 270. This instrument appears to have been in favour as an accompaniment of
the dance. Roquefort gives it another appellation, estz've; and in the list of Minstrels
who played before Edward I. in 1306, when Prince Edward was knighted, are found
Hamond Lestivour, and Geffrai le Estivour. See the volume presented to the Rox-
burghe Cluh by Mr. Botfield, on Manners and Household Expenses in England, p. 142.

³ The term corpores, corporalis palla, denotes a consecrated linen eloth, folded and
placed upon the altar in the service of the mass, beneath the sacred elements. Its
symbolica} import, allusive to the fine linen in which the body of Christ was wrapped,
