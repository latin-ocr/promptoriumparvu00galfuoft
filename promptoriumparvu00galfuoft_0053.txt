PREFACE. xli

It is on parchment, 106 leaves, dimensions 10} inches by 7ss inches. The
writing is of the close of the fifteenth century, in double columns, the
initial letters marked with a yellow stain instead of rubrication, as is not
uncommonly seen in English MSS. of the fifteenth century. This is not
shown in the fae-simile. This MS. is unfortunately imperfect3 it commences
with the word ‘⁶ Bowntevousnesse.” Of many leaves only fragments
remain, and it ends abruptly at ‘⁶ Tryin a truthe be doom,'’ the concluding
line being the first of the second column on the reverse of the leaf, as if
the scribe had discontinued his task; and on the blank space of the lower
part of the page are several scribblings: ‘⁶ Sum ,Iohannis Saulfi '’ (twice);
a hare; a quaint pen sketch of a pedagogue. possibly John Saulfi‚ holding
an open book in his left hand, and in his right a short staff or palmer for
the correction of his scholars3 also a squirrel, and other performances of
boyish penmanship. This MS. is of considerable interest. It was unfor-
tunately unknown to me until a great portion of the present edition had
been printed off.

The various readings and additions obtained by a partial collation of
this MS. are indicated by the letter (A). It will be observed that the
collation has been carried out in the later part of the volume only.

It is possible that a MS. formerly in the library of ⁴‘ Abraam Seller . . .
viri antiquitatum ecclesiasticarum pe1·itissimi,⁷⁷ may have been an imperfect
copy of the Promptorium. It is described as a folio volume, “ 3,774‚ Dictio-
narium Anglo-Latinum, in pergamen. ante annos 200 scriptum, ἀκέφαλον
και μείουρον.” catal. MSS. Angliae‚ tom. ii. p. 96; published in 1697.ξι

Having thus described the existing MSS. which I have succeeded in
discovering, I have now to notice the editions issued by Pynson, Wynkyn
de Worde, and Julian N otary, all of these being of the greatest rarity.

what source the MS. had come into his hands3 on the first leaf are the class marks of
some former possessor—L. 6. 26, and W. 7. The early portion is in a fragmentary state,
until fo. 6, beginning with the word Candelere, after which the continuity is broken
at intervals, until the letter T.

¹ Abraam or Abednego Seller was a writer of some note on matters ecclesiastical in
his day. His chief works are “ Remarques relating to the State of the Church of the
first eenturies,” Lond. 16803 ‘⁶ History of Passive Obedience since the Reformation‚'' &c
Amst. 16893 ‘⁶ History of Self-Defence,” &c. See Ant. Wood, Watt, and Lowndes. I
have not succeeded in ascertaining what became of his libraryg some of his MSS. are in
the libi-ary of the University of Cambridge.
