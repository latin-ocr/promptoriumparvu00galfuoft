¹ Compare the verb OVYR ΗΥΡΡΥΝ, 01· ouer skyppyh‘. Hyppynge occurs in the sense
of hopping, Vis. of P. Ploughm. 11‚488‚ and to hip has in the North a like signification ;
hipping stones are steppings at the passage of a shallow stream. The word seems here
to be taken from the irregular movement or bopping of the halt person. Gower says

of Vulcan,

“ He had a courbe upon his hacke,
And therto he was hippe halte.'' Conf. Am.

Amongst the various significatione of napta, given in the Catholicon‚ it is said ‘⁶ napta
etiam, secundum Papiam, diciturpem-ymnentztm linz'.” The word occurs in the Wicliffite
version, Judges xvi. 9; “And sche criede to him, Sampson! Felisteis ben 011 hee,
which brak be boondis as if a man brekith a brede of herdis (filum (le stupui, Vulg.)
wribun wib spotle.’' Chaucer, in the Rom. of Rose, describes the dress of Fraunchise‚
called a suckeny, or rokette‚

“ That not of hempe herdes was,
So faire was none in all Arras.''

In the original, “we fut de bourras.” In Norfolk, according to Forby, hards signify
eoarse flax, otherwise tow-hards, in other parts of England called hurds; and in many
plaeesacoarse kind of linen eloth is still tei-med harden, or hir-den. The Invent. of
the effects of Sir John Conyers‚ of Sockburne, Durham‚ 1567, comprises “ vij. har-den
