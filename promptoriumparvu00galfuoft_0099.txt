the authorities, which are omitted in his printed work. The following
notices of the Campus F lorum occur at fol. 30, but not under the author's
name :—“ Campus Florum vocabularius quidam erat apud Miram vallem,
locum devotis monachis valde amenum, factus circa annum Domini

Under the article of Thomas Walleys, fol. 176, 1119 work is thus noticed
more brieflyz—“Thomas Walleys Dominicanus', doctor W⁷allicus,'' &c
and at the end of the list of his writings,—“Campus Florum, copiosus

Nicholas Brigan, or Brigham, called by Bale in his printed work
“ Brigamus‚⁷' was his contelnporary,—“ Anglicarum antiquitatum amator
maximus;” he compiled, about 1550, certain collections which seem to
have been used by Bale, entitled ‘⁴ Venationes rerum memorabilium,'' also
“ Rerum quotidianorum, lib. xii.'' Bale, Script., p. 718.ἱί

Sir Frederic Madden notices that the name “ Thomae Gualensis'’ had
been added above the line in the passage above cited; he considers this
interlineation to be subsequent to the original entry, but not later than
1552, the latest date that he found in the volume. It would seem that
Bale had really seen a copy of 1119 work at Magdalen College3 he certainly
assumes that Thomas XValleys was the author. No MS. corresponding
with his description appears 10 be found at 1119 present time, and I have
sought for it in vain, either in the enumeration of MSS. 111 1119 library
of Magdalen College, given about 1697 111 09191. MSS. Angl., tom. 1,
part 2, p. 71, or in the recent and valuable Catalogue compiled by Mr.
Ooxe. I have been equally unsuceessful in my endeavors to trace the
MS. described by Leland as existing 111 1119 Public Libraiy 91 Oxford.

⁸ Pits, p. 749, writes in eommendation of the eruditiori of Brigham, of his repnte as a
lawyer, histor-ian, poet, and antiquary. In 1555 Brigham caused the remains of Chaueer
to be removed to the chapel of St. Blaise in Wcstminster Abbey‚ and deposited in the
marble tomb which bears a Latin verse composed by him. See Wood's Athenae.
