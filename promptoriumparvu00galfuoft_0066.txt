13. MS. in the possession of Sir Thomas Phillipps, Bart. No. 8244,
formerly in Heber's library, Io. 10:203 imperfect, on paper. It contains
many English words3 the last word is ‘⁶ Vespilio.'’

14. MS. in the same collection as the last. No. 8306. Bound up
with a transcript of the Promptorium described p. xl. supra. The two dic-
tionaries appear to have been written by the same hand. The Medulla
begins on p. 167. It is imperfect in several parts, aud ends with ‘⁵ Tz'cz‘o,
a brond of fyre,” p. 342. On paper. From Heber’s libi-ary, No. 1360.

15. MS. in the Library of King Edward's Grammar School at Shrews-
bury. “ Incipit liber intitulatus Medulla gramatice. v' Fructum gramatice
qu’ medullam de b1·euitate.” The shelf mark is X. 29.

16. MS. in the library of the Earl of Leicester at Holkham, Norfolk.
It is cited by Sir Frederic Madden in his glossary to Havelok, edited by
him for the Roxburghe Club in 1828, as a Latin-English vocabulary of
the middle of the fifteenth century, and substantially the same as the
Ortus Vocalmlorum.a Chiefly on paper, partly on vellum. Its resemblance
to the Medulla appears by extracts, for which I am indebted to the Rev.
R. Collyer, Hon. Canon of Norwich.

17. ln the enumeration “ Librorum MSS. Henrici Worseley de Hos-
pitio Lincolniensi apud Londinium,'' 0. 1697, occurs “ No. 6914.OE ;
Medulla Grammaticae sive Dictionarium Latino-Anglicum.'’ Catal. MSS.
Angliae, tom. ii. p. 213. Ι have not been able to trace where this copy
may now be preserved.b

II. Ortus Vocabulomm.--The first Latin—English Dictionary printed in
this country3 in great measure, as it would appear, based upon the Medulla

ἃ The name of ‘¹ Sire John Mendames‚’' parson of “ Bromenstrope ’³ (Brunsthorp)
occurring in this MS„ has been supposed to be that of the xwiter, but it is more probably
the name of a former owner of the book. In the list of incumbents of Brunsthorp
John Mendham occurs. He was collated in 1529, and resigned the preferment iu 1532.

b There existed formerly a MS. in the Chapter Library at Exeter Cathedral, thus
noticed in the brief catalogue given in Catal. MSS. Angliae, tom. ii. p. 55. ‘⁴ 2057-3,
Dictionarium seu Glossarium Latinum, mutilum.'' This MS. which, from information
formerly received, I had hoped might prove to be a copy of the Medulla, is not to be
found, as I am assured by Mr. Charles Tucker, after eareful search in the depositories
of the Chapter. It is not mentioned in the short enumeration of MSS. at Exeter in
1752. See Dr. Oliver's Lives of the Bishops of meter, App. p. 376.
