¹ “ Cupidinarius, i. mereator, nummos cupiens, a coueytour of money.'’ ORTUS. In
the Vision of Piers P. v. l4‚448‚ the disorderly followers of an army are described as
“brybours, pylours‚ and pyke—harneys.’' This last term occurs also in Towneley
Myst. p. 9. The verb to pick‚ as used by the old writers, has, amongst various signi-
fications. that of obtaining anything by mean, underhand proceedings, or pilfering.
Thus Gaut. de Bibelesworth says,

“ Eschuuetflatour (loseniour) ke seetflater,
Trop seet ben espeluker (piken.)'’ Arund. MS. 22⁷0, f. 299.

“ Leue thy flaterynge wordes, that goth aboute to pyke a thanke (verbis ad qratiam

‘2 ‘⁴ Ι pyke, or make elene, z'e nettoye. I praye you pyke my combe. Ι pyke safforne
or any floure or corne whan I sorte one parte of them from an other, Ie espluche. All
men can nat pycke saffron, some men must pyke pesyn.'' PALSG. Chaucer uses
this verb, speaking thus of the spruce Damian: ‘⁶ He kembeth him, he proineth him
and piketh.” Marchant’s T. v. 9885. Again he describes the gear of the five artificers.
who were clad in the livery of a great fraternity, as “ ful freshe, and newe—ypiked.”
Prol. v. 367. See Nares¹ v. Picked. Bullinger, in his 40th Sermon on the Apocalypse,
inveighing against the Roman clergy, says, ‘⁴ They be commed, and piked‚ and very
finely apparelled, delightyng in wemens jewels. wearing costely garmentes.’' There is
apparently an allusion to birds, which set the plumage with the bill. A.-S. pycan, eruere.

Sax. pylce, toqa pellicea. A cyrtell of wollen, and a pylche. Polychr. li. vii. e. 4. Cled

Chaucer, denotiug a warm wrapper: Proverb against Covetise 3 it occurs also in Creed
