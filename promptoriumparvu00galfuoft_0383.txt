¹ “ Delicias, puer in deliciis matris nutritus, a eokenay. Collibista, qui recipit
munuscula pro usur& et servicio aliqua, et qui vendit collibia, el (licitur a cokenay.'’
ΜΕΙ). MS. CANT. The term seems here to signify a little eook. In the vision of P.
Ploughman, line 4371, it had been supposed to have this meaning; but Mr. XVriglm
in his Glossary, suggests that it implies some kind of meagre food, as a small cock, which,
by comparison with Turnam. of Tottenham, Anc. Poet. ii. 24, and Heywood's Prov. pt. i.
c. xi. seems highly probable. “ Coqzaine, a eockney, simperdeeoekit, nice thing.” COTG.
“A cockney‚ m'ais, miynot, cailketle. A waspish coekney dame, yzcespitze.” SHERW. “ A
cockney‚ or child tenderly brought up: mammothreptus, vinciolus, pedagium, delz'liae
pueri,'' Sco. GOULDM. Tusser uses the word in thie last sense, as given in the Prompto-
gum: speaking of the nursery, and defeets of early training, he says, in his Points of

uswifery,

“ Some coekmzys, with cocking, are made very fools,
Fit neither for 'prentice‚ for plough, nor for schools.'’

See the note on the word COKNAY, p. 863 and Fuller's Worthies, London.

² In the Household Book of Sir John Homul, in 1466, is the item, ‘⁵ for yonge koke-
relles to make of caperis, ix.cl.'' “ Kockerell‚ cocltel.” PALSG.

³ The treatise here cited is attributed to Joh. de Garlandie, and has been printed.
MSS. of it may be found in Harl. MS. 4967, art. 18; Arund. MS. 52, art. 14.

⁴ See the note on CUKSTOKE‚ p. 107, where the reading cukstolle‚ according to the
other three MSS. is probably more correct. The following observation occurs amongst
Bp. Kennett's Coll. Lansd. MS. 1033: “A goging stool, a ‹lucking stool, or cucking
stool, called in Domesday cathedra stercoris, properly a gonging stool, gong stool‚ οι· gang
stool. Sax. gong stole, sella familiaris, a close stool.'' That such was sometimes its
form is proved by the engraving in Boys' Hist. of Sandwich, which exhibite the
cucking-stool and wooden mortar used there for the punishment of scolds3 see pp.
500, 785. In a satire on the evil government of the times of Edw. ΙΙ. it is said, in
reference to the corrupt dealings of the assisours, (Polit. Songs‚ ed. Wright, 3450
