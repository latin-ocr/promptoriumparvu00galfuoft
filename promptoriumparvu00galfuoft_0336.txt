¹ The heyward was the keeper of cattle in a common field, who prevented trespass on
the cultivated ground. According to the Anglo-Saxon law the haeig-weard was to have
his reward from the part of the crop nearest to the pastureS, or, if land were allotted, it
was to be adjacent to the same. See Ane. Laws and Inst. i. 441. His office is thus

noticed by G. de Bibelesworth :
“ Ly messiers (hayward) acl les chaumps en cm·e.”

“ In tyme of heruest mery it is ynough;
The hayward bloweth mel-y his horne,
In eueryehe felde ripe is eorne.” Κ. Alis. 5756.

Bp. Kennett observes that there were two kinds of offellarc‘i„ the common hercl-ward of
a town or village, called bubulcus, who overlooked the common herd, and kept it within
bounds3 aud the heyward of the lord of the manor, or religious house. who was regu-
larly swern at the court, took care of the tillage, paid the labourers, and looked after
trespasses and eneroachments z he was termed fields-man, or tithing-man‚ and his wages
in 1425 were a noble. “Inchsarivs, a l]eyewarde.” MED. ‘¹ mansorius, a pynner of

Forby notices a bequest of certain ‘'heekfordes'' in the will of a Norfolk clergyman,

to slope, as a declivity. See Brockett, Craven Dial. and Jamieson, v. Heild. Aug.-
