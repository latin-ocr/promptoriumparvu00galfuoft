iape with hym, and he toke it in good ernest. Iape, a trifyll, truffe.” PALSG. ‘⁸ Ic vz'est
pas ῃαε, it is no-iapest' Harl. MS. 219. It is said of St. Nicholas in the Golden Legend,
that “in his yonge age he eschexved γε playes and iapes of other yonge chyldren.''
Fabyan relates that william Rufus was warned of his approaching end, ‘⁸ but he set all
at nought‚ and made of it a scoffe, or a iape.'' Horman says, “he bete me cursedly with
a rod, as it had ben in iape, velut per ludum. Leue thy iapys, mitte πνρας. At the
begynnynge I hadde wente thou haddeste iapyde, putavi te joco fecisse.'' Junius has
detailed the use of this word, especially by chancer, and seeks a derivation by comparison
with Isl. geip, jactatio. Skinner derives it from Fr. yaber. It appears, moreover,
from Speght's Glossary‚ appended to Chaucer, that, having become of ambiguous import,
the word was scarcely admitted in polite parlancc 3 and this is confirmed by Palsgrave,
who gives the verb ⁴‘ I iape a wenche, ie foul, and z‘e bistocqzce. It is better to iape a
wenche than to do worse.''

³ Gerarde speaks of ‘⁴ a large sweet almond, vulgarly termed a Jordan almond.''

⁴ Javel or jevel is a term of contempt, which signifieS‚ according to Bp. Kennett, “ a
rascal or base fellow.''

“ Lat be, quoth Jock, and eall'd him Jevel‚
And by the tail him tugged.” Christ Kirk, st. 7.

Forte a Sax. ge-fulL immundus, profanus, reus, putidus ,· or ge-fyll. The Lieutenant of
the Tower, advising Sir Thomas More to put on worse clothes at his execution, gave this
reason, because he that is to have them is butaJavel: to which Sir Thomas replied,
“ Shall I count him a Javel who is to doe me so great a benefit? ” Lansd. MS. 1033.
In Roper's Life of More the term employed is ‘³ raskall.’' Skelton uses the word javell
frequently ι it is one of the opprobrious epithets that are put into the mouth of Wolsey,
in ‘⁶ Why come ye not to court :2 ” and occurs in a passage cited by ΗΘΜ-118, and attri-
buted to Skelton, Glossary to Langt. Chron. v. Wroken.

“ These be as knappishe knackes,
As ever man made,
For javells and for jackes,
A jym jam for ajade.” Nares
