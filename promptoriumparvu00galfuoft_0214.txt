Richard, Harl. MS. 1319. Archaeologia, vol. xx, Chaucer uses also the diminutive
dagon3 thus in the Sompnoures Tale the importunate Friar, who went from house to
house to collect anything he could lay hands upon, craves ‘¹ adagon of your blanket,
leve (131110.” Ang. Sax. “ dag, anything that is loose, dagling, dangling.” SOMN.

¹ A bed-covering, or a garment formed of frize, or some material with long thrums
like a carpet, was termed a daggysweyne ; lodix is explained in the Ortus to be “ quic-
quid in lecto supponitur, et proprie pannus villosus, Angylice a blanket.’' Horman says,
“my bed is covered with 3 daggeswaine and a quylte (yausupe et centone) some dag-
waynys haue longe thrumys (fructillos) and iagg3 on bothe sydes⁷ some but on one.'' So
likewise Elyot gives ‘⁴ Gausapa a mantell to caste on a bed, also a carpet to lay on a
table, some cal it a dagswayne.'’ Andrew Borde, in the Introduction of Knowledge,
1542, puts the following speech in the mouths of the Frycelanders ε

“ And symple rayment doth 501110 115 full well,
With dagswaynes and roudges we be content.’'

Harrison relates in the description of England, written in Essex during the reign of
Elizabeth, that the old men in his village used to say, “our fathers (yea and we our
selues also) haue lien full oft vpon straw pallets‚ on rough mats couered onelie with a
sheet, under couerlets made of dagswain, or hopharlots (Ι vse their owne termes) and a
good round log vnder their heads insteed of 3 bolster.'' Holinshed‚ Chi-on. i. 188.

³ The Council of &Vorcesten in 1240, ordained regarding the Clergy, “nec ludant
ad aleas uel taxillos ,· the latter game was probably the same which is here termed
DAYLY, but in what respect it difl'ered from ordinary dice—play has not been ascer-
tained. Ducange supposes it may have been the same as the French “z‘rictruc9 ludus
scrupulorum.'’ Horman says that “ men pley with 3 dice, and children with 4 dalies,
astrayulis 'cel talis. wolde God 1 coude nat playe at the dalys‚ aleam. Cutte this
flessche into daleys, tessellas.’'

⁴ Delk, according to Forby, signifies in Norfolk 3 small cavity either in the soil, or
the flesh of the body. In this last sense the gloss on Gautier de Bibelesworth inter-
grets the expression “au cool troueret la fossat, a dalke in be nekke.’' Arund. MS.

⁵ The dalmatic is a sacred vestment, 50 named, according to St. Isidore, from its having
originated in Dalmatia, and was introduced into the Christian church by St. silvester,
