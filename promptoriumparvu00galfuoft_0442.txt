Roquefort gives the following explanation of the French word, whence this appears to
be taken: ‘⁴ RIester, mestier: besam, neeessairest’ διο. Chaucer uses the word “ mis-
tere‚’' signifying need, as of daily food, in the comparison between the wealthy miser
and the poor man ; R. of Rose, v. 5614; and again, in the sense of requiring the ser-
vices of any one; see the address of Love to False Semblant, ib. v. 6078. See
Towneley Myst. pp. 90, ⁶234, and Jamieson, zv. Mister.

2 The position of this word in the alphabetical arrangement would indicate that the
reading of the Cambridge MS. is here to be preferred. Mynute was, however, used
synonymously with mite, as appears by the passage in the Wicliffite version, Mark xii.
42, quoted in the note on cu, halfe a farthynge‚ p. 106. Gouldman gives “ a minute,
or q. which is half a fai-thing, minutum.‘’ It is said in the Ortus, “mimatam est
quoddam qenus ponderis, scilicet media pars quadrantis ‚·” and a distinction appears to
be made in the following citation: ‘⁶ A myte, mita: a myte, quod est pondus, mi-
nzctam.’' CATH. ANG. Palsgrave gives “myte, the leest coyne that is, pite,” which
was a little piece struck at Poitiers, pictavino, and of the value of half an obole; and
Sherwood renders “Mite (the smallest of weights‚ or of coine) Minute; aussi, vne
petite piece de momzoye non vsite‘el’ There is no evidence that any coin of such value
was ever struck in England, but small foreign pieces may have been cirmlated, such as
the Poz'tevz'ne, or the “dyner of Genoa‚” which also, according to R. Holme, was
worth half a farthing. Acad. of Arm. B. 111. c. 30. Roquefort explains mite as sig-
nifying a Flemish copper coin 3 but, according to Ducange, the value ofthe Flemish mita
was four eboli. Itis, however, possible that fractional parts of the silver penny or farthing
might occasionally pass as mites z thus entries frequently occur in the Accounts of the
Keeper of St. Cuthbert's Shrine, during the thh cent. as cited by Raine, respecting
“fracta pecunia ,·'’ and the petition of the Commons in 14⁴⁴, 523 Hen. VI. complains
of the great injury that arose from the division of coin, for want of small currency, and
craves that the breaking of white money be forbidden under a heavy penalty. Rot. Parl.
V. 109.

3 “1ῑ1ἱία est pilamfrz'yz'mn, or a myttane. Alontas, a myteyn, or a mantell.'’
ORTUs. ‘⁴ A mytane, mitta, mitana.'’ CATH. ΑΚΘ. In the curious dictionary of
John de Garlandia it is said that “ cirothecarii decipiunt scolares Parisius (sic) ven-
dendo cirothecas simplices, etfzcrratas pellibus ayninis, cuniculinis, vulpinis, et mictas
de coriofactaS.” The following explanation is given in the gloss: “ Mitem, Gallice
mitanes (mitlzeiaes, al.) (ι mitos, qaod estsexam, quia primo-fiebant defilo vel de panno
laneo, et adhuc-fiunt a vzclyo.” MS. Bibl. Rothorn. Itis said in the Catholicon that
‘⁶ a manus dicitur mantas, quia manus teyat tantum, est enim brevis amictus,” &c.
