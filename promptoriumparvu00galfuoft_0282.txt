¹ A satisfactory interpretation of this word has in vain been sought. The practice of
buying up woollen yarn for exportation was carried to a great extent in Norfolk. and
other parts of England. It was highly injurious to the interests of the eloth-workers‚
and occasioned loss to the revenue. Many enactments appear in the statutes to protect
both the weavers of Norfolk‚ and the customs‚ against the crafty proceedings of merchants,
both strangers and denizens, ‘⁴ regrators and gatherers of woll.’' See particularly stat.

froyd may imply the artful diligence with which covetous traders persisted in eluding the
statutas, and robbing the staple manufacturers of Norfolk. Jamieson explains “ frody ''
as signifying cunning ·, Teut. vroed, industrius, attentas ad rem. In the North, according
to Brockett‚ froating means anxious unremitting industry.

‘-' A pancake is called in the Eastern counties a froyse, a term derived, as Skinner
conjectures, either from ,fo-imre, or the French finissem because the substances of which
it is compounded are beaten up together. Forby gives, as a Norfolk proverb, the following
phrase: ⁴‘ If it won't pudding, it will froize;'' if it won't do for one purpose, it will for
another. See ancient recipes in the Forme of Cury, p. 96; and the “Kalendare de
Leche Metys. Froyse out of Lentyn.'' Harl. MS. 299, f. 36. ‘⁸ Froyse of egges, doz-te
d'cmle' PALSG. Voulte d’oeufs is the ancient appellation of an omelet. “Fr-ttitla, a
froyse or pancake.” ELYOT.

³ A small frog, according to Forby, is called in Norfolk a fresher. The distinction
which appears to be here made between FROGGE, tode, and ῈΒΟΚΕ, or frosche, is possibly
dialectical; they seem properly, however, to be synonymouS‚ the former derived from
AS. frogga‚ rara, while the latter assimilates more nearly to the Germ. frosch, Dan.
frosk, a frog, Tooms, fowle wyrme, occurs hereafter. ‘⁴ Rana, a froske, or frogge.''
οισι-5. “ A froske, agredula, rana, 7·ubeta‚ranula.” CATH. ANG. ln the Golden Legend,
in the Life of St. Peter, is a relation of the deecit practised upon Nero by his physicians‚
when he ordered them, ‘⁶ Make ye me w‘ chylde, and after to be delyuered‚ y‘ I may
know what payne my moder sufl'red: which by craft they gaue to hym a yonge frosshe
to drynke, and it grewe in his hely.''
