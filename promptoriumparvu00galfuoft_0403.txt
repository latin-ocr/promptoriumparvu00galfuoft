‘² The lightning, or any sudden gleam of light, is frequently termed by the old
writers levene‚ a word which has been derived from Ang.—Sax. hlifiau, rutilare. See
Lye, and Jamieson, v. Levin. R. Brunne,(lescribing the engines ‹levised by Richard
Coeur de Lion, to throw wild fire and stones, at the seige of Acre, says that “ as leuen
be fire out „schem” Langt. Chron. p. 174. Compare Havelok, 2690 ; Ywaine and
Gawain, Ritson, Metr. R. i. p. 17 ; Cant. Tales, 58:383 Gower, Conf. Am.; Townel.
Myst. pp. 39, 116; Cov. Myst. 156. Fabyan relates that in 7 Hen. 1, “was sene an

³ The verb to leve is used in this sense by R. Gloue. p. 30; it occurs repeatedly in

⁴¹ Glergy‚ as it has been remarked in the note, p. 81, signif-ies erudition‚ precisely
according to the sense of the French cle›yie; and the word is thus to be understood in
the term ‘⁶ benefit of clergy.¹’ See Barrington's observatione on statute 4 Hen. VII.
The use of the word in this acceptation is, however, a striking evidence of the general
ignorance that prevailed amongst all classes, churchmen alone exeepted‚ so that the
