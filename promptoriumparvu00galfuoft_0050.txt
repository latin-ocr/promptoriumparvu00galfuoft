and a few words scarcely legible, which may be read—“ Ex providencia
willelmi Grene,'' whose name occurs repeatedly elsewhere as before
noticed; he may have been either the scribe or the donor.

In the present edition all various readings and additions obtained by
collation of this MS. are indicated by the letter (S). It is with grateful
satisfaction that Ι would express my acknowledgment of the liberality of
the Dean and Chapter in entrusting to me, through the friendly mediation
of Mr. VaUX‚ a volume of such value, and from which 1 have derived
much assistance in my undertaking.

5. MS. in the library of Sir Thomas Phillipps, Bam, collated, by his
kind permissi0n‚ at Middle Hill (No. 8306, Heber Library No. 1360). It
is on paper, dimensions 11} inches by 81} inches. The writing is in
double columns in a small neat hand of the close of the fifteenth century
with rubricated initials3 the English words are underlined with red. The
Promptorium extends to p. 166. On the first column of p. 167 is
written in red ink, “Explicit liber dictus Promtorius Paruulorum,” &e-
as iu other MSS. and immediately after, ‘⁵ Brooke owyt yis Boke hoso
wyssly loke.’' The name of this former owner, “ Joh‘es Br0ke‚⁷' occurs
repeatedly, also “Thomas lVade‚’⁷ and, in a handwriting of later date
(? xvii. stem), ‘⁵ Henry Sherbrooke.” On the second or right-hand column
of p. 167 commences the Latin-English Dictionary entitled “Medulla
Grammatice‚’' and written apparently by the same scribe as the Prompto-
rius. It is imperfect in several parts,a and ends with the word “ Τ1010,
onis, a brond of fyre,” p. 342¹> In this MS. y is used instead of p. A few
peculiarities in spelling deserve notice5 for instance, almyhty‚ bryth, flyht,
t'cythtyn‚ lyth‚ syth, ryth, nyth, instead of almyghty, bryght‚ &03 qwat‚
qul, qhyp, qhyth7 dcc. for what, whyle, whyppe, Sec. The verbs some-
times terminate in -ng. thus, “ Betydyng, happyng.''

In the present edition all various readings and additions obtained by
collation of this MS. are indicated by the letter (H).
