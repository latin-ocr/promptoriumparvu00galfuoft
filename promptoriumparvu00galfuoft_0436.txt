the Cambridge MS. ln the Catholicon maialz's is explained to be “porcus domesticus

Vi'inchester MS. agrees here in the reading MESTYF, otherwise it might have been con-

being apparently from the Ang.-Sax. maestan, sayinare. Skinner supposes that the
word mastiff, denoting a dog of unusual size, is also thence derived ; but it seems more
probable that it was taken from the old French mestg'f, which, according to Cotgrave,
signified a mongrel. In the Craven Dialect a great dog is still called a masty.

It was used in France in the concoction of beer, as appears by the regulations for the
brewers of Paris, 1954, who were to use “yrai7zs‚ c'est ὰ savoir, d’orye, de mestuel, et
