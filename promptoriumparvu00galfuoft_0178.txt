¹ “ And kisseth hire swete and chirketh as a sparwe with his lippes.'' Sompnoures
Tale. “ 'l‘o chyrke, make a noyse as myse do in a house.” PALSG.

“ All full of chirking was that sory place.” Knightes Tale.

³ CHYRRYNGE, MS.

⁴ Thomas, in his Italian Grammar 1548, gives “Bzffa, the dispisyng blaste of the
mouthe that we call shi1·ping.”

⁵ The Latin-English Vocabulary, Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII. gives “aq-ena, grawell,
sabulum, sande, 9Zaria, chesylle,” f. 37, and again, f. 56, “ nomina lapidum, yloeria,
chesylle.'’ The etymology of the name Chesil Bank, in Dorsetshire, a singular bank of
pebbleS, which extends nearly seven miles S.E. from Abbotsbury, and abuts at Chesilton
on the isle of Portland‚ is here clearly ascertained. See, prefixed to Holinsheds Chron.
the description of the Chesill, by Harrison, Descr. of Brit. p. 58. Harrison speaks
also of the Chesill at Seaton, in Devonshire, where he says “the mouth of the Axe
is closed by a mightie bar of pibble stones‚” p. 59, and copies the account given by
Leland, ltin. iii. f. 42: ‘⁶ The men of Seton began of late day to stake and make a
mayne waulle withyn the Haven—and ther to have trenchid thorough the chisille‚ and to
have let out the Ax, and receyvid in the mayn se. But this purpose cam not to effect.
Me thought that nature most wrought to trench the chisil hard to Seton Town, and ther
to let in the se.” 111 this instance the term chisel seems to accord with the explanation
given in the Medulla, “Glarea, aryilla, ‘ccl primam lapides qnos aqua fluviatilis
trahit.” Harl. MS. 2257. It implies‚ however, in a more general sense the pebbles
on the shore3 thus in the Coventry Mysteries, p. 56, is the following paraphrase of
Genes. xxii. 17:

‘⁶ As sond in the see dothe ebbe and flowe,
Hath cheselys many unnumerable.”

In the Wicliffite version this passage is rendered “grav-el which is in be brink of he
see.'' Ang. Sax. ceosel, ylarea, sabulum. Teut. kesel. In Norsolk, chizzly signifies dry
and harsh under 'the teeth, which Forby derives from Teut. kias-ele, yluma. The Latin-
English Vocabulary, Harl. MS. 1002, f. 147, gives among “pertinencia pislrc'ne, Catala-
brnm, Angdic& ehycelle.”

⁶ “Cliitei-lynge, scilla?⁹ cun. ANG. ‘⁷‘ Chyterling, encloile.” PALSG. Horman says,
“Let us have trypis, chetterlyngis, and tryllybubbys ynough, suppeditet (culicoctia ad
satietatemst' Skinner derives the word from Teut. kntteln, intestina.

7 Chaucer writes in the Blake Knygffl, “ 1 chiver for defaut of hetess' and Gower
