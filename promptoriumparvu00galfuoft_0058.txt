composed of the sun and stars, and the initials W C (william Caxton) with
iiiterlaced Arabic numerals 743 at the bottom are a greyhound⁷ sagittarius,
and the name ‘⁶ XVynkyn de Worde” on a scroll. On the reverse—‘⁴ ἾῙ Incipit
prologus in libellum qui dicitur promptuarium.-—Cernentibus solicite cleri-
corum‚⁷' &c. as in Pynson's edition before described, and also, a few various
readings excepted, in the MSS.; see p. l, infra. On the second leaf,
sign. A. ij„ commence “ Nomina Α.-ἿῘ Incipit liber qui dicitur Promptua-
rium paruulorum siue cle1·icormn.” On the last leaf, recto, we find, after
the verbs cominencing with Y, a note and two distiches relating to the
conjugations of verbs, to which immediately succeed a notice ‘⁸ Ad lecto-
reum—ss And yf ye can not fynde a laten worde,‘' ἇῑο. as given p. 540,
infra, and the colophon “ (Π Ad laudem et honorem omnipotentis dvi

Resides the numerous editions by VVynkyn de Worde in small quarto the
Promptorium was printed in 1508 by Julian Notary in the same conveni-
ently portable form, suited for the requirements of students. A single copy
is known; it is preserved in the library of the late Right Hon. Thomas Gren-
ville, now in the British Museuni.¹’ I cannot refrain from grateful acknow-
ledgment of his liberal courtesy in entrusting to methis and also other
precious volumes, from which I have derived no slight advantage. This
edition is mentioned by Ames, but Mr. Grenville observed, adverting to the
volume in his own possession, “ Ι do not get trace of any other copy of it.'’
The volume consists of 73 leaves. The text appears to follow that given
by WVynkyn de WVorde3 the pages are printed in double columns, sign.

Ἀ It may deserve mention that the verbs are mostly printed with the termination
yn or e113 in a few instances, however, with a finale, as “agyvne, semo,- seyne, dico,-
atachyne,” 8ιο. or ynge, as ‘⁶ pargettynge walles, yipso‚· poyntynge, or porti-aym, piu-qo ,·“’
and not unfrequently the peculiar form of the A.-Sax0n gerundia] infinitive‚ followed
in the MSS. of the Promptorium (sce p. xlviii„ infra) is laid aside3 for instance we find in
W. de Worde's edition “amende, bende bowe5‚ consent,'' διο. The words written in the
MSS. with 3, and so printed by Pynson, are printed with ῥ’.
