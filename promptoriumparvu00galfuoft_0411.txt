well adapted to serve as a distinctive mark. This, in later times, assumed the form of
a round cap, to which was appendcd the long Ziripipizwn, which might be rolled around
the head, but more commonly was worn hanging over the arm, and vestiges of it may,
still be traced in the dress of civic livcry-men. The statute 7 Henry IV. expressly per-
mits the adoption of such distinctive dress by fraternities, and ‘⁸' les [Jeme de onestere,”
the trades of the cities of the realun, being ordained with good intent; and to this pre-
valent usage Chaucer alludes where he describes five artificers of various callings, who
joined the pilgrimage‚ clothed all ‘⁶ in o livere of a solempne and grcte fraternite.”
Prol. ν. 365. By the same statute, lords, knights, and esquires were allowed, in time of
war, to distinguish their retainers by similar external marks, the prototypes of military
uniforms. In the metrical paraphrase of Vegeeiu3‚ entitled ‘⁶ Of Knyghthode and
Batayle‚’' Cott. MS. Titus, A. XXIII. f. ⁵22, it is said that ancient usage had ordaincd
three kinds of signs in an army, vocal, semivocal, as trumpet or clarion, and a third which
is noiseless‚

‘⁶ And mute it hight, or dombe, as is dragoun,
Or th'cgss, or tlI'ymage‚ or the penoun,
Baner, pensel, plesaunce. or tusto, or creste,
Or lyuereys on shilder‚ arm, or breste.''

In this passage the collar is evidently one of the liveries to which allusion is made. It
was much in fashion at the time when the Promptoriuin was compilcd. See COLLEIi, οι·
lyuerey, p. 87; and the curicus dissertations on collars of the royal livery, by ΜΓ. J. G.
Nichols, Gent. Mag. 1842. Mueh infornmtion rcspecting external distinctions, as the
original of uniforms, will be found in thc Τνιιίίὲ des marques orationales, by Beneton de
Peyrins. ‘⁴ A lyveray of clothe, liberata ,· hic et hec liberatalis.” CATH. ANG. “ Lyueray
gyuen of a gentylmau, Zizcerf’e.” PALSG. See Douce’s Illustr. of Shakcsp. 'saming of the
ShreW, Act IV.

¹ “ Com-odium, a lyuerey in a abbaye.'’ MED. Harl. MS. 2257. “A lyveray of mete,
corrodium.” CATH. ANG. Conredlzcm, corredzcm, or corrodium, implied generally an
alimony or allowance, ‘² proeltemla monachi vel canonici.” DL’CANGE. Thus in the
Custumal of Evesham it is directed that for a whole year after the deccase of an abbot
or monk‚ his entire “ com-e‹lz'mn” should be allowed, to be given to the poor. for the
good of his soul.'' Mon. Aug. i. 149. The term ‘⁶ livrere—liueray⁷' occurs in this
sense of a daily pittance for food, Amis and Amssoun, 1640, 1659; in the Houschold
Ordinances the daily allowance of meat and drink received by each individufss is com-
monly termed his livery, and the livery cupboard was the buffet appointed in apart-
ments of greater state to receive this provision at certain times. The term corrody
implied also more particularly a kind of pension, either for life or in reversim), with
which a monastery was charged, granted by the founder to a kinsman or retainer, οι· by
the house for service rendered, or some valuable consideration. The Sovereign instituted
corrodies in favour of royal dependants, and spelman observes that 119 monasterias,
charged with one, and in some cases two such corrodies, were, as it may thence be
supposed, of royal foundation. The injurious practice by heads of monasterics, who
made traffic in such pensions for their own advantage, was restricted by the Constitutione
of the Legate Othoboni, in 1267, which forbade them to sell and charge their estab-
lishments with ‘⁶ liberationes seu corrodioess‘ especially when granted in perpetuity. See
further the notes of Joh. dc Athona, Constit. Legatin. p. 150, cd. 1679 , and Ducange,
v. Conreclizcm.
