PREPACE. XXV

Brito was, according to Pits, a native of Wales of ancient British race,
a monk of the Franciscan order versed in the learning of his times, and
his writings were highly in esteem in foreign lands: he died at Grimsby
in 1356ss It does not appear that the Summa has been printed. Another
treatise entitled Synonyma ascribed to Brito was, according to Fabricius,
printed at Paris in 1508. MSS. of the Summa are to be found in the
British Museum, Sloane MS. 3319 3 Add. MS. 10‚350, from Heber’s library,
see also Lambeth MS. 1903 MS. Coll. Ball. Oxon., xi.; and MSS. Univ.
Libr. Cantabr., Catal. vol. iii.‚ p. 451.

4. Mirivalensis in Campo Florum.—A large number of Latin words,
including many of obscure and curious character,b are cited as derived
from this work, for which I have made diligent search hitherto in vain.
In the library of St. Peter's College, Cambridge, there is a treatise thus
described3 “ No. 1748, 86. Liber cui tit. Campus florum. Pr. Fulcite me
floribus. Observat ordinem Alphabeticum.'⁷e This treatise, however,
consisting of short common-places from the fathers and canonists‚ has
proved on examination wholly different from the Campus Florum used in the
compilation of the Promptorium. I have failed equally in the endeavor
to identify the place or monastery from which the name of the author
may have been taken. The Cistercian Abbey of Mereval (de Mira Valle)

b It may be well to cite a few Latin words given on the authority of the Campus
Γίονῑιηῑ,ο the following will be serviceable, in any future inquiry, for purposes of com-
parison, if any work thus entitled should be brought to 1ight3 it may have been known
by some other title, and hence my search has been fruitless. “Appulmoce, dyschmete3
pomacium. Astelle, a schyyd; tecla. Babulle 3 pegma. Bane of a pley3 cora-qiam.
Baselarde3 sica. Caraway, herbe3 carwy, sic scribitur in campo florum. Hey benche;

words will show how varied the conteuts of the Campus Florum must have been.

c Catal. MSS. Angliae‚ vol. ii. p. 149. The title was taken from the Canticles, and
also because, as the author states, he had compiled the work “ contemplacione venerabilis
patris domini mei domini archiepiscopi Panormitani, videlicet domini Theobaldi de
Ursinis de Campo Florum,'' to whom he had transmitted it for correction. In the Uni-
versity library, Cambridge, is a MS. treatise entitled “ Pratum Florum ,” beginning “ Gram-
matice flores presens liber insinuabit.” XIV. cent., MS. 1619, f. 98. catal. vol. iii.p. 240.
