¹ This may be derived from τοίαν-ευ as also irregular soldiery were termed. in Low
Latin, rulariz' or rotarii. Palsgrave gives the verb ‘⁶ I mitte—I assemble together in
routes, or Ι §tyre aboute, je me arroute. I lyke nat this geare, that γ’ commens begynneth
to route on this facyon.’' See Jamieson, v. Royt.

2 Rome, MS.

3 The power of the trrminal contraction is questionable, and may be ρι’-35 in uer.

4 RoxxYN appears to signify congealed or run together,—Ang.-Sax. Gmwinnen,
eoa-qulatus, as milk is coagulated by renuet, called in Gloucestershire running. See also
Jaussesou, v. To Rin, to become curdled, &c. As here used in reference to the knotted
wood, of which masers were made, the term RONNYN seems to describe the coagulated
appearance of the mottled grain, not dissimilar to ropy curds. See the note on MASERE,
supra, p. 328. Iu the note on Donoi'. p. 125, it has been suggested that the reading
of the MS. may be corrupt, and that the word should be Dogofi. In the winchester
MS. is found—“ Doiofi', Doqena.” This various reaiing had not been noticed‚ when
the above mentioned note was printed. Dojoun, or dudge0n‚ appears to denote some
kind of wood, used in like manner as the motley-grained material called Maser, but its
precise nature has not been ascertained.

ὓ Hau, relating the wiles practised by the Duke of Gloucester, says he persuaded
the Queen that it was inexpedient to surround the young King Edward with a strong
force, when he was brought to London for his coronation‚ for sear of reviving old
vari-<mee of parties, ‘⁸ and thus should all the realme fal in a roare.'’ Hormau says—
·‘ 311 the world was full of fere and in 3 roare (sollicitudinis complebatur).'’ ‘⁶ Rore,
trouble, trouble.” muso.
