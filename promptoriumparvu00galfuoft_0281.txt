¹ Ray gives among his N. Country words ‘⁶ to frist, to trust for a time.'’ ΑΒ. syrstan,
inducias facere. Jamieson explains it as signifying in the primary sense to delay‚ or
postpone, and thence to give on credit, to grant delay as to payment. Germ. fristen,
proroyare tempus ayendi. ⁴· To friste, induciare.’' CATH. ANG.

² ‘⁶ A froke, cucuHusf' ΟΑΤΗ, ANG. There is much ambiguity in the use of the term
froccus, the monastic frock, which occasionally appears to have been confounded with the
cuculla, although properly a distinct garment. At the General Council at Vienna, 1312,
Clement V. defined the cuculla to be a long, full, and sleeveless garment; the ιΤῖοσσῖωῖ,
considered identical with froccus, to be a long habit, with long and wide sleeves. They
are evidently distinguished by Ingulph, who states among the ordinances of Egelric,
Abbot of Croyland from 975 to 992. ‘⁶ Induit omni cmno totum conventum cum scotti suti
de tunicis, omni altero almo de cucullis, et omni tertio anno de froccis.'' Rerum Angl-
Script. i. 54. The distinction appears likewise to be made by M. Paris, where he speaks
of the unbeooming changes in monastic attire, introduced at St. Alban's during the time
of Abbot Wulnoth, towards the close of the Xth cent. So also in the cnumeration of
garments allowed by custom to each monk of Glastonbury‚ at the latter part of the
XIth cent. it is stated, ‘⁸‘ unusquisque fratrum {j cucullas, et &fo-occos, et zj sumaim, et ᾖ
femoralia habere debet, et iv calissas, et peliciam novum per sinyulos annos? G. de Malmsb.
de Antiqu. Glast. Hearne, ed. Domerham, i. 1] 9. At an early period the cowl appears
to have been portion of a sleeveless garment which sometimes was a mere cape, but occa-
sionally reached quite to the heels‚ and was worn over the long, full, and sleeved habit
tei-med a frook. See the illustrative plates in Muratori. Script. Ital. i. part 2. Chron.
Vulturnense; Mabill. Anu. Bened. i. 121. At asubsequent time it seems that these
gat-ments ceased to be distinct, and the long dress of the monk, having the cowl atzached
to it, was tei-med indifferentlyfrocczcs,froeno, and—floccus, (η- rucnlln. Further infui-matini)
on this subject will be found iu Dum-ange.
