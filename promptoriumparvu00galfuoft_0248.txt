aeguum, faegenian‚ gyonclere, which has also the signification of flattcring. Hardyng,
relating the guileful practices ofVortigern on the weak King Constaunee, says,

‘⁶ Such subtyle nteane to fage the Kyng 110 fande.” Chron. c. lxvi.

Coles gives “fage, a meriy tale.” Palsgrave gives the verb “I fagge from the trouthe
(Lydgate); this terme is nat in our comen use.’' It may be questioned whether Drayton
does not use the verb to fadge in this sense3 but 11 15 explained by the Glossarists as
signifying only to agree, or accord; Ang.—SaX. fegan,junyere.

‘⁶ With flattery my muse could neuer fadge.’' Pastorals, Ecl. 3.

² It would 31 first sight. appear from this reading of the MS. as also from a word that
occurs subsequently, Ὲοκςεῑϊῑ, or for3etyfi‚ that the initial ff must have some special
power of its own, and not merely represent the capital F. None such, however. can be
assigned, and the readings are, probably, in both 1051311005 corrupted by the scribe. In
the present case the correction appears to be FAYNE, or fawne, and in the second the
true reading may be FOR3ETYR or forgetyfi. “Fayiie, ubi mery. Alacery apricus, (ῑὶ-

³ The appellation fair child, belfils, 01· nEFx’CE, which has occurred previously, was
0110 of endearment or courtesy, afterwards used only to signify a son-in-law. Instances
of its use are not infrequent3 thus in Piers Ploughman's Vision, when Joseph relates
to his father his dream that the sun, moon, and stars ‘⁴ hailsed hym a11,”

‘⁶ Beau fitz, quod 1115 fader,
For defaute we shullen,
Ι nib-sels and my sones,
Seche thee for neede.” line 4819.

⁴ A FAYTOWRE was, as it seems, 3 conjuror, or a quack—salver‚ so called from ‘the
French finite-or, or ‚rofino-ier, a sorcerer; and thence the name was applied to itinerant
pretenders to such skill, to mendicants, and generally to idle lix-ers. “Faz'tzw·cl,faz'ceor‚
vn ytczro·csson.⁷:.” LACOMBE. The plant called quaclx-salver's turbith or spurge, the
Yt'thsmalas or Esaia of the old botanists, Eaphorbia, Linn. was much employed in
homely physic, as also by the empirios in former times. Its virtues are detailed by
&erardo and Parkinson. See TITYMALLE. The MS. has similawr, as also similacio.
