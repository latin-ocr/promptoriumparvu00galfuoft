¹ Fabyan, in his Chron. part vi. 0. 197, suggests the faneiful etymology of this term,
which is likewise given by Boethius, in his Hist. Scot. published in 1526, lib. x. s. 20,
and adopted by Verstegan, in his remarks on names of contempt, e. x. namely, that a
Dane being quartered as a spy in every family 111 England, was, from his tyranny‚ called
Lord Dane, ‘⁸ quhilk is now tane for ane ydyll lymmer that seikis 1113 leuyng on other
mennis laubouris‚” as Bellenden expresses it in his version. The immediate derivation
13, however, evidently from the Freneh ; ‘⁴ Lourclz‘n, lourdayne ; blunt, somewhat
blockish; a little clownish, lumpish, rude3 smelling of the churle, or lobcock.'' COTG.
‘⁶ Lourcleiu: idios, Zourclaud, mcdadroit, sot,· 811 bas Lat. Lurdus.'' ROQUEF. R. Brunne
says that Sibriht, King of lVessex, when driven from his realm, “as a lordan gan lusk ;”
p. 9. The word occurs in the Vision of P. Ploughman, lines 12,278, 14,302; Townl.
Myst. pp. 60, and 308. “A lurdane, ubi a thefe.’' CATH. ANG. ¹‘ Lurdayne, lovrtlccvlt.
It is a goodly syght to se a yonge lourdayne play the lorell (loricarder) on this facyon.”
PALSG. “A lourdon, or sot, bardus.” GOULDM. It denotes a vile person, a sot or
blockhead, a clownish churl, or a sluggard. Andrew Boorde, in the Breviary of Heahh,
1573, quaintly observes at the close of his directions regarding severs, ‘⁶ The 151 chapiter
doth shew of 811 811911 feuer the which doth eomber yonge persons, named the feuer
lurden,'' with which many are sore affected now a days, from bad edueation, or natural
habit. In the last ease he pronounces it incurable, but offers the following nostrum:
‘⁴ There is nothing so good for the feuer lurden 83 unquentum baculiuum, that is to saye,
Take a sticke 01· wan of a yeard of length and more, and let it be as great as a man’s
fynger, and with it anoint the backe and the shoulders well morning and eueniug, and
doo this xxj. dayes; and if this sever will not be holpen in that time, let them beware of
wagging in the galowes; and whiles they do take their medicine, put no Lubberwort into
their potage, and be(w)are of knauering about their heart3 and if this will not help, send
them to Newgate, for if you wyll not, they wyll bryng them selfe thether at length.” In
e. 262 he speaks also of “luskeshnes, brother to the fener lurden.'’ See Broekett and
Jamieson.

² Counterfeit sterlings, closely resembling the pennies of the English coinage, but of
inferior value, appear to have been largely introduced during the reign of Edward ΙΙΙ. and
were probably, as Skinner suggests, termed Lushborows from their having been issued at
