In Arund. MS. 42, f. 26, it is said of Carduus that it is “ on of be noblest mete bat is for

¹ KENE‚ MS. kne, K. s. Palsgrave gives the following curious observation, to illus-
trate the use of the verb to kneel: “The men of this countray knele vpon one knee
whan they here masse, but ye frenche men knele vpon.bothe.''

2 In W. Thorpe's recital of his examination by Abp. Arundel, 1407, he states that
when charged with having preached heresy at St. Chad’s, Shrewsbury, he made answer,
“ As I stood there in the pulpit, busying me to teach the eommandment of God, there
knilled a sacring bell, and therefore mickle people turned away hastily, and with noise
ran fro towards me ·‚” this circumstance called forth the expression which had been con-
strued into heresy. “ I knolle a belle, Ie frappe da batant.” PALSG. Ang.-Sax. cnyllan,
campan& sissnum dare. Bp. Kennett remarks that in Yorkshire a passing bell is called
“ a sawl-knill, from Ang.-Sax. sawl‚ anima, and cnyll‚ campana> pulsatz'0.'’ Lansd. MS.

³ Tyro is explained in the Catholicon to be novus miles. noviter electus ad militianm
but implied, perhaps, more properly, the novice in arms, who sought occasions for warlike
exercise at home and abroad, until his approved prowess should entitle him to the honour
of knighthood. See Ducange, the Memoirs of St. Palaye, and other writers on chivalry.
Scarcely any of the ancient Romances afford a more graphio and stirring picture of the
edueation and adventure of the Tyro than the life of le petit ‹lekan de Saisztre, written
about the period when the Promptorium was eompiled. The practice of wandering on
the uncertain quest of adventure was by no means laid aside when the novice had won his
spurs. “ Knyght of aduentures, clceualier errautst' PALSG.

⁴ The verb to knit is used by old writers in the sense of to unite. Thus in Sloane MS.
3548, f. 99, b. is given an extraordinary nostrum “for to knyt synous bat are brokyne.
Take greyte wormes bat are called angeltwycthys‚ and lat hem dry in be sunne,
