of brewis in the North of England. BROCKETT. Huloet, in the reign of Edward VI.
speaks of ‘⁴ browesse, made with bread and fat meat.'’

“ A proverbe sayde in ful old langage,
That teudre browyee made with a many-boon,
For fieble stomakes is holsum in potage.’'
Lydgate, Order of Fooles, Harl. MS. 2251, f. 303.

The Latin-English Vocabulary‚ Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII. gives ‘⁵ browys, adepatum,
brewett, yar1·us‚” distinguishing these two words, as the Promptorium does. Brewes is
derived from the plural of A.S. briw, jusculum ‚· but brewett is a word adopted from the
French, ὄνομα, potage or broth. Palsgrave, however, gives ‘⁶ brewesse, potage of fysshe
or flessbe, b7·0aet.''

¹ in the Forme of Cur-y, and other books of ancient cookery, will be found a variety
of recipes for making bren-ets, such as brewet of Almony, or Germany, of ayrenne, or
eggs, eels, and other fish in bruet. In a MS. of the XVth century, in the possession of
Sir Thomas Phillipps, No. 8:336, occur “Eruet seec, bruet salmene, and bruet sara—
zineys blanc.” The word seems to have been applied generally to any description of
potage3 but Roquefort defines the original meaning of broue‘c as ‘⁶ clcczudeau, et ce que
les nom-estus· marie.»- dommim( ὰ leurs compagnons pour boire, le jour de leurs noces.”

² Guntier de Bibelesworth, in his Tretyz de Langage. written in the reign of Edward Ι.
gives a detailed and curicus account of malting aud brewing, “ de bre-ser, et de bracer.”
Arund. MS. 220. In Harrison’s Description of mimine, Book ii. cll. 6, prefixed to
Holinshed's Chronicles, will be found a minute description of the process of brewing, as
practised in the Eastern counties in the XVIth century.

³ In Anglo-Saxon mere-swyn siguifies a dolphin; the epithet brun, fuscus, is pro-
bably in reference to the colour of the fish. lt is the poi-pesse, perhaps, which is in
many places called sea-swine, in Italian porcopesse, that is here intended.
