a 10581 to be “ one that bath lost, neglected. or cast off his own good, and 5ο 15 become
lcwde, and 03181855 of credit and honesty.’' Names of Contempt, p. 262. Lorel 1135 been
derived from Aug-sax. leoran, as likewise 10581 from leosan, perdere. Both occur
repeatedly in the Vis. of P. Ploughman; Chaucer, in his version of Boethius, B. i. ren-
ders ‘⁶perditissimaacm—lorell‚” and uses 1118 word in the Wife of Bath's Prol. 5855, and
Plowman‘s Tale, ed. Speght, 1601, f. 91. See also Ly beans disconus, 259, “ 101811 and
kaytyf.'' In Rich. C. (18 Lion, 1864, 1875, the French King speaks of the English as
cowards and “10531(15.” Ι11 the Boke of Curtesy, t. Hen. VI. the youth sitting at the
table of a great man is admonished thus ε

Holinshed terms Wat Tyler “a naughtie and lewd lozzell.’' Chron. iii. 432. Skelton
uses the word “ loselry.'' and both ‘⁶ 1011811 ” and ‘⁴ lozell’' occur in Spenser, and
other later writers. “ Lorrell or losell, fetari, loricart.'' PALSG. “Loricam-cl, a

² Tooke considers this word as derived evidently from the past part. of Aug-Sam
hlisan, celebrare: it 15, however, more probable that it was taken from the French, los,
loz, which seems to be always used in a good sense, whereas the English word signifies
either praise or dispraise,—renown on account of vice, as well as of virtue. In the
sense of praise it 0001115, R. Glouc. p. 1893 R. Brunne, p. 253 Vis. of P. Ploughm. 71643

of name, p. 148.

³ Compare SPANGLE, or losangle (sie). Lorale. In 1118 Ortus Lorale is rendered ¹¹ 3
lorayne, 3 brydell.'' but lorum implies any strap or band of leatlicr3 and as at the
period when the Promptorium was compiled the fashion of attaching pendant ornaments
to the girdle and the baldrick, the reins and the trappings of 1101585, was singulm-ly pre-
valent, 11 may perhaps be concludcd that LOSANGE, 01· spangle, here ‹lenotes these deco-
rations, which were occasionally, but not invariably‚ of a lozenge form.
