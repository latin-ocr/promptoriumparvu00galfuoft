⁴² The martyroloyz'um was, in the earlier times, the register of names of saints and
martyrs, which served to bring each successively to the memory of the faithful. on the
anniversary of his Passion. At a later period the term denoted, in monastic establish-
ments especially, the register more properly called necroloyz'um, or obituary‚ wherein
were inscribed the obits and benefactions of those who had been received into the fra-
ternity of the congregation, and whose names were thus in due course brought to mind,
being recited day by day in the chapter, and suitable prayers said. The martyrology
was termed also liber vitae, and the memorial inscribed annotatio Ite-(sulm, because it was
generally annexed to the Rule, and connected therewith was the obituary, wherein the
deaths of abbots, priors, and members of the congregation in general, were recorded.
The martyroloyium occurs next to the regula canonicorum, among the gifts of Bp.
Leofric to Exeter‚ in 1050. The nature of the entries made may be seen by Leland's
“thingges excerptid out of the martyrologe booke at Saresbyri,’' and at Hereford.
Itin. iii. f. 64; viii. f. 79. A remarkable specimen of such a register is supplied by the
Liber Vitae of Durham,commencing from Xth century3 corr. MS. DOM. A. vu. See
Kennett's Glossary to Par. Ant. In the version of Vegecius attributed to Trevisa,
Roy. MS. 18 A. XII. it is said that the Roman legions, ‘⁴ with her ehosen horsemen
i-rolled in the constables martiloge (matricum), were euer-more myghty i-nowe to kepe
her wardes.⁷' without auxiliaries. Β. ii. e. 2. It is here put sor the muster-roll,
termed album, or pittacium.

³ The martinet or martlet is the Hirundo urbica, Linn. and both appellations appear
to have been taken from the French. Skinner considers it to be a diminutive of the
proper name, comparing the usage of calling a parrot or a starling Richard, or a ram
Robert, and rejects as fanciful the conjecture of Minsheu that the name martinet was
given in allusion to its arrival at the end of March, and migration before St. Martin's
day. “ Martynet, a byrde. marti7zet.'' PALsc.

⁴ The term marrow is used in this sense by Tusser, but appears to be no longer
known in East Anglia. It is retained in the Northern, Shropshire, and Exmoor
dialects; see the quotations given in the Craven Glossary, and Jamieson. It occurs in
the Townl. Myst. p. 110. ‘⁴ A marrow, or fellow, socius.” GOULDM. Minsheu would
derive it from the Hebrew.
