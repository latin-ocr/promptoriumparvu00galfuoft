“ Oriloge, a clocke, heriloye.‘' PALSG. In the sense of a dial the term occurs in the
Wicliffite version, iv. Kings, xx. ll ; “ Isaye be profete clepide ynwardly ,be Lord, and
br0w3te a3en bacward by x. degrees be schadewe bi lynes, bi whiche it hadde go doun
banne in be orologie of Achaz.'’ Daines Barrington has given observations on the
earliest introduction of clocks, Archaeol. v. 416, but could find no instance of an horo-
loyium, which, being described as striking the hours, was undeniably a clock, and not
a dial, previously to the construction of the remarkable clock near &Vestminster Hall,
supplied out of a fine imposed on Rad. de Hengham‚ Chiefjustice of the King‘s Bench,
19'58. But there can be little question that clocks were in use at an earlier period. It
may be doubted whether the “ Oreloyizcm insiy'ne ’³ given by william the Sacrist to
Sherborn, in the XIIth cent„ were of this nature (Sherborn Cartulary, in the possession
of Sir Thos. Phillipps); and the Izoroloyz‘wn, or alarum, the fall of which before the
honr of matins gave the alarm of the conflagration of the church of Bury, in 1198, as
described by Jocelin de Brakelonda, p. 78, appears by the context to have been a kind of
clepsydra. Numerous notices might be collected regarding the orloges of a later time,
such as that in Canterbury CathedraL which eost έ30, in 12993 and the celebrated
one given to the Church of St. Alban's in 1396, by Abbot Ric. de VVallingford, which,
as it is stated, Cott. MS. Nero, D. vu. f. 196, surpassed any other in England, or even
in Europe, according to Leland, Seript. Brit. ii. 401. A remarkable clock still exists at
Exeter‚ generally regarded as the gift of Bp. Courtenay, who was consecrated 147 8, but
it is highly probable that it is the same leoroloyium which is named in Pat. 11 Edw. II.
1317. Frequent mention occurs of ‘¹ lzoroloyz'i Reyis infra palatium IVestm',” as in
Pat. 1 Hen. V. in favour of the keeper, Heu. Berton‚ ‘⁸ valectus· camere Reqz‘sfl’ and
in the Acts of Privy Council, especially in 6 Hen. VI. 1428, vol. iii. ⁶288, where ac-
counts of repairs done to the “ orelege ” may be found, which supply curious terms of
the craft. Amongst the valuable effects of Hen. V. enumerated 1423, was “j. orlage,
fait al manere ‹l'un nief, l'aryeut prez’s’ par estimatiorz, lau-§⁸3⁷ Rot. Parl. iv. ⁶216.
Fabyan relates, on the authority of Gaguin, that amongst the presents sent A.D. 807 to
Charlemagne by the King of Persia ⁴⁶ was an horologe of a clocke of laten of a wonder
artyfycyall makyng, that at euery oure of the daye and nyghte, when the sayd clocke
shuld stryke, images on horse backe apperyd out of sondry places, and aftir departid
agayn by meane of certayne vyces.‘’ Part VI. c. 156. To such a device Horman seems
to allude when he says, f. ²231, το, “ Some for a tryfull pley the deuyll in the orlege;
aliqui in mtyis {suffodias oyttnt.'' It seems, however, certain from the Chron. Turon.
Martem, Coll. Ampl. V. 960, and Eginh. Ann. Fr. that Charlemagne’s “horologe'’
was a clepsydra. Abp. Pal-ker devised in 1575, to the Bp. of Ely, “baculum meum de
