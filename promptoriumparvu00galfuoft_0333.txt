the former being rendered ‘¹ the tmnsam, or lintell,” the latter “the hanse of a door.’'
Cotgrave gives “ comrefmntaic, the brow peece, or upmost post of a doore, a haunse, or
breast summer.” At first sight it may appear doubtful whether heynyn or heyuyn (to
heave) be the true reading; but by eonsidering the position in the alphabetical arrange-
ment of the word heynynge, subsequently, the former appears to be correct. Compare
Ang.-Sax. heau, evehere. Heithyn may be perhaps traced to Aug-sax. beabo, culmen.
In the version of Vegecius, Β. iv. c. 19, it is said that the city wall, when a bastile or
“ somer castel '' is brought against it, should be “ euhaunsed '' and made higher, and
describes the means to be adopted by the assailants “ayenst this highething” of the
wall. Roy. MS. 18 Α. XII. “ I haythe, Ι nyte on hcythe. ze hemlee. Hayth this tester
(kaulcez ce ciel) a lytell. 1 heyghten‚ I set vp a heythe‚ ie excelse. This balke (trqf) is
heythened two foote.'’ PALSG. ,
¹ In the Romance of Coer de Lion, Tancred says to King Richard that he had heard

“ That thou art comme, with gret power,
Me to bereve my landes hower.'' line 1714.

Weber interprets the word as meaning hire, possession (rythmi qratifi.) “ Havoir'’
occurs in Chaucer's Rom. of the Rose, line 4720, in the signification of wealssx, avoir.
Sir John Maundevile, describing the good dispositions of the folk of the lsle of Bmgman,
says that they are neither covetous nor cnvious‚ “and thei 3ive no charge of aveer‚ ne
of ricehesse:” p. 354. In the regulations for the government of Prince Edward, sou
of Edward IV. 1474, is this clause: ‘⁶ We wyll that the hall be ordynately served, and
strangers served and cherished according to their haveures.” Househ. Ordin. p. ³²29.
In the Golden Legend mention is made of ‘⁴ coueytous men that sette all theyr Ioue in
hauyour‚ and in solace of ye world.” See Kennett, and spelman, v. Avera.

² “Anticffi a gate, or a dore, or hatche. Est antica domus inme-382& ab anteriori.”
ORTUS. “An heke, (mztical’ CATH. ANG. “Ostfflbum, hek.'’ Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII.
f. 27. “ Hatche of a dore, laecq.’' PALSG. “ Gzciclzet, a wicket‚ or hateh of a doore.’'
COTG. Forby gives ‘⁴ back, half-back, a hateh, a door divided across.” In the North,
a heck door is one partly lattieed and partly panelled. See Brockett.

³ See HEVEDARE, hereafter. “ A hangeman or an heeder is odiose to loke vpon.'' HORM.

⁴ The head-borough‚ borwealder, borsholder, or tithing man„ was the chief of the
friborgh or tithing, the subdivision of ten freemen, called hand—boroughs, or franci
pleyii, who were mutually bound to the King for the good conduct of each other. Aug.-
