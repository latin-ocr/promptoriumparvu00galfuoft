quently described in Inventories‚ as in one taken at York cathedral, and printed in
Mon. Angl.‚ in which is mentioned ‘⁶ uua Ze pendant parva de (mro Veneto, cum lapi-
dibus el pe1·les.” Moram-alam, in French wordum, is usually taken in the sense of
the tongue of the buckle‚ but oceasionally appears to signify a distinct ornament of the
girdle. ‘⁴ Pendant of a gyrdell, Joemlantff’ PALsG.

¹ Palsgrave gives this terni, denoting a plumb-line. ‘⁴ Pendant for carpenters,
niueau.”

² PENNE is not unfrequently used by the old writers in the sense of fealherg Fr.
penne. In the Vision of Piers Pl. mention occurs of the ‘⁴ pennes of the pecok.'' v,
7923. In the Golden Legend it is said that ⁴¹ the foule that—bathe but fewe pennes
or sethei-s, may not well flee ;‘' and again, “David sayth, he flewe vpon the pennes of
the w ndes.”

3 Aypennon was a small flag attached to the lance, whereby the rank ofthebearer was
known. Wace appropriates it to the knight, and the gonfanon to the baron, but atalater
time it appears to have designated the bachelor. Oliv. de la Marche describes the cere-
mony of the bacheler being made abanneret, when the “ queue du pemzon armoye‘” was
eut off, ‘⁴ et demeum (μιαγέ,” was converted into a banner.’' L. vi. c. 25. Trevisa, in
his version of Vegecius‚ Roy. MS. 13 A. XII. says that “horsmen ben eleped the
wynges of the hoost—and thies ben cleped banarers, for they bere baners and pynons3
velis, hoc eslflammulis uthlur.” B. ii. c. l. In an Invent. of church ornaments, in
the enumeration of banners. occurs “ a pynon off St. Donston.’' Gent. Mag. viii. N.S.
571. ‘⁶ Pennon, a banner, pennen. Penon, a lytell bauer in a felde, pen7zon.'⁷ PALSG.
In Lansd. MS. ⁶225, f. 431, is given the size of standardS, banners, pennons, &c. as set
down by the Constable and Marshal. “A guydon to bein length ij. yardes and a
half, or iij. A pennon of armes round att the end, and to be in length ij. yardes.” In
Harl. MS. 358. f. 5, may be seen sketches of all these ensigns; the getone being
swallow-tailed, the penon triangular, and charged with the armorial bearing, the former
being appropi-iared to the esquire or gentleman‚ the latter to the knight.

4 “A penytenciary, penitenciarius.'' CATH. ANG. The institution of this dignity
in eathedral churches is usually dated from the Council of Trent, 1545 ; but it is certain
that poenilemz'arii, persons authorised in certain cases to give absolution‚ in place of the
bishop himself, existed from a much earlier period. See Ducange and Macer. Chaucer
speaks of the peniteneer in the Persones Tale as one empowered to give absolution in
extraordinary cases. “ Penytauncer. penitancz'er.” PALSG.

⁵ Ina French Vocabulary, Harl. MS. 919, f. 148, v⁰‚ is given “ eiectice, a pentys.”
