¹ It would hence appear that the recita] of gests, the deeds of confliet or gallantry,
which was the proper business of the gestour, was aecompanied by appropriate aetion,
or gesticulation. “ Gestz're, i. (sescus facere, scilicet diversis modis essitare, gyaudere,
luxuriari, dcc-’³ οΑΤΠ. Hearne stated erroneously that gests were opposed to romanoe,
Chron. Langt. pref. p. 37; a mistake which Wartou has properly corrected. Chaucer
uses “to geste‚'' to relate gests3 and “to tell in gests;” Cant. T. 17354, 13,861;
and these passages apparently imply that gests were chiefly written in alliterative
verse. He calls the Gesta. Romanorum, “the Romaiu gestes.” See Tyrwhitt's notes
on Cant. Τ. 17354. 13575, and Warton's Eng. Poetry. “Gest, a tale. Gestyng,
bourde, bourde.'' PALSG.

² Palsgrave gives “gette, a custome; newe ieme, {saise nouvelleff' This phrase occurs
often in the old writers. In a poem on the dissolute lives of the clergy, in the reign of
Edw. ΙΙ. ΡοΙίῑ.Ἑοη3’3, ed. Wrigha p. 329, some, it is said,

“ Adihteth him a gay wenche of the newe jet.'' line 118.

“ Yit a poynte of the new gett to telle wille Ι not blyn‚
Of prankyd gownes, and shulders up set, mos and flokkes sewyd wyth in.'’
Towneley Myst. 312.

Chaucer says the gay pardoner thought he rode “ al of the newe get.'' or fashion ; and he
also uses the word in the sense of erafty contrivance‚ where he relates the deeeit praetised
by the Alehemist, by means of a stick filled with silver filings.

“ And with his stikke above the erosselet,
That was ordained with that false get,
He stirreth the coles.’' Chan. Yem. T. 16,745.

³ It appears that in former times great virtues were attributed to jet. Alex. Nec-
cham, Abbot of Cirencester, who died A.D. 1217, says in his work De Rerum Natura,
“ Gayates . . . aqud ardet, olco 7·estiayn,ilm·.· attritu calefactus applicata (Intimi, acque
succinum: ydropicis illum portantibus beneficivmprestat.'’ lib. ii. c. 97, Roy. MS. 12 G.
XI. f. 53. The observation of the electric properties of this mineral led him in the
succeeding chapter to make some detailed remarks “cle vi ιἰίιν(ισίὶῑ.·α,” among which
will be found a notice of the use of the magnet by mariners. In Trevisa's version of
Barth. de propr. rerum, are the following observations: “Gette hyght gagates, and
is a boystous stone, and neuer the less it is precious.’' Itis best and most abundant
in Britain, of two kinds, yellow and blaek, both of which have by friction the power of
attracting light substances. It drives away adders, relieves fantasies, and lias virtues
against the visits of fiends by night. “And so if so boystus a stone dothe So greate
wonderS. none shuld be dispisid for foule eolour without, while the vertu that is hid
within is vnknowe.'' lib. xvi. c. 49. It was also regarded as a test of virginity, and
rendering signal aid in parturition; these, and other properties, are notieed in Caxton's
