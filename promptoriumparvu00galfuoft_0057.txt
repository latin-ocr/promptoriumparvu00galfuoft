PREFACE. xlv

only; in those which I have seen I perceived no essential variations in the
text. A copy of that of 1516, formerly in Heber’s library and obtained
by Sir F rederic Madden in 1836, has been, among many kindnesses which
I have received at his hands, entrusted for my use throughout the prepa-
ration of this volume.a Occasionally the Latin-English dictionary, Ortus
Vocabulorum, printed by the same printer and in the like form, is found
bound up with the Promptorium for the convenience of students. Dibdin
remarks that Wynkyn dc Worde's Promptuarium Parvulorum was an
abridgment of the dictionary of which the editio princeps had issued from
Pynson‘s press with the title ‘⁴ Promptorius puerorum ”3 the omissions are
principally, however, of some porticus of the Latin explanatione, and of
references to authorities, whilst occasionally English synonyms, &c. are
added in the smaller volume. The variations in the title may be without
any material siguificance. The following brief description of this rare
book will here suffice.b

The volume consists of 69 leaves, sign. A. ij. to M. iij. 3 it is printed in
double columns, with running titles distinguishing the Nomina from the
Verba, as in Pynson's edition.

Title.-“ Promptuarium paruulorum clericorum: quod apud nos Medulla
grammatice appellatur. Scolasticis quam maxime necessarium. Impres—
sum Londoniis per wynandum de worde hac in vrbe in parochia sancte
Brigide (in the fletestrete) ad signum solis commorantem.” On 1116 11116 15
introduced the well-known wood-cut device used by Wynkyn de WVorde,

in 4. de 70 ff., reimpr. en 1522 et en 1528.’' Ι am not aware on what authority this
mention of any edition without date is made. The Ortus Vocabulorum having been printed
by W. de Worde in 1500, as hereafter notieed, it may be supposed that he likewise pro-
duced an edition of the Promptorium about the same period as a convenient accompani-
ment. None has been found earlier than the edition of 1510, which is described by
Dibdin as the first from that prese». He mentions a fine copy in the late Mr. Roger
WVilbraham's library.

³ This copy is in old brown calf, and in good condition; the Ortus Vocabulorum,
edit. 1518, precedes the Promptorium. The name “Mylles Blomefylde of Bury St.
Edmunde'' is written several times on the title pages. “ Myles Blomefylde owe this
booke,” &c. Another copy of the Promptorium, edit. 1516, 15 111 1116 Grenville Library
111 1116 British Museum, and also one of edit. 1528. A fine clean copy of edit. 1516
is in the Public Library at Cambridge; another is in the Bodleian, Tanner coll. No. 271.
