Cautio,

signification of to carry. Caxton says, in the Boke for Travellers, ‘⁴ Richer the earter
shall lede dong (melio-a) on my land, whan it shall be ered, and on my herber (courtil)
whan it shall be doluen.’'

¹ ‘⁴ CasingS, stercus siccum jumentorum, quod pauperes ayri Lincolniensz's ad usum
foci colliffzcue; α Teuc. Koth, fimus, q. d. cothings.” SKINNER. In the North, ac-
cording to Brockett‚ easings, οι· eassons, are now-dung dried for fuel. It is still the
usage in the neighbourhood of Lynn to employ cow-dung for this purpose. Richards’
Hist. i. 80.

² The Wicliffite version renders, ii. Pet. 2, 22, “ The hounde turnyde agen to his
castyng.'' In Sloan. MS. 100, f. 5, b. is given the following prescription: “ For eastinge,
For hem that may not browke her mete. Take centorie, and sethe it in watir, and lete
the sike drink it leuc warm iii daies, and he schal be hool, for this medieyn spourgith the
brest, and the stomak.”

³ ‘⁴ Catyrpyllar‚ worme, clmtte pellezcse.'' PALSG.

⁴ In the middle ages a metrical system of ethius, entitled “ Disticha de moribus acl
filium,'' attributed to Dionysius Cato, or Magnus Cato, had attaifled the highest degree
of estimation. It was illustrated by the comments of the most learned men of several
centuries, and served as a manual for the instruction of youth. It is not certain who
was the author 3 a translation from the Latin was made about 1480, by Benedict Burgh,
Arehdeacon of Colchester, for the use of his pupil Lord Bourchier3 and in 1483
Caxton published his translation from a French version, entitled “The Booke called
Cathon.‘' Chaucer frequently quotes Cato ε see Miller's Tale, 3227, Marchaunt’s Tale,
9261. Caxton says, in the Boke for Travellers, “George the booke sellar hath doe·
trinals, catons, oures of our Lasly, Donettis. partis. accident3.’' See Warton‘s Hist. of
Eng. Poetry, ii. 166, Dibdin's Typogr. Antiq. i. 195.

⁵ Caucyon may here signify a pledge, as in Palsgmve, “causion, pledge, caution.'’
See hereafter wEDDE, οι· thynge leyyd yn plegge. The Catholicon, however, explains
cautio to be a simple promise, without oath, pledge, or surety, but idonea cautio implied
those additional seeurities. It is further interpreted to be a writing, as Papias says,
“ Cautio est breve recordatz'onz's chirogsraplcum. Unde in Evany. Isaac. : Accipe cautionem
tuamff' In the Wieliffite Version this passage is rendered ‘⁶ and he seide to him, take
thy caucioun and wryte fifty.'' Luke xvi. 6.
