¹ ‘⁸ A muskett, capus.‘⁷ cATH. ANG. ‘⁶ Musket, a lytell hauke, mouenetl’ PALSG.
⁴‘ Mouchet, espece d'oz'seau de proye, c'est le tiercelet de l’espervz'ew’ NlcoT. The
most ancient names of fire-arms and artillery being derived either from monsters, as
dragous or serpents, or from birds of prey, in allusion to velocity of movement, this
little hawk supplied the appellation musket3 as also at a much earlier period it had
furnished a name for the missile termed muschetta, or mouchette, in the XIIIth cent.

² ‘⁴ Must, carenum, mustum.’' eATH. ANG. ‘⁴ Mustacium, ι. mustum vinum, vel
potus (qui) ea· mustofit, et aliis potionibus.⁷’ onrus. Mulsa, or mulsus, according to
the Catholicon, was a drink compounded of wine, or water, and honey, commonly
called meed ; occasionally the term denotes new wine, which is the usual signification
of must, as in the Wieliffite version, Dedis ii. 133 Cov. Myst. p. 38⁶2. ‘⁴ Must, newe
wyne, movst.’‘ PALSG. ln AElfric's Glossary, Julius, A. 11. f. 1⁶27, are given ‘⁴ cervisa,
vel celea, eale ; medo, meodu; ydromellum, vel mulsum, beor.‘' Horman says, ‘⁴ We
shall drynke methe, or metheglin ; mulsum vel hydromeL non medonem.” According
to the account given of Apomel, in Arund. MS. 42, f. 32, νῦ, mulsa, or mellic-ratium,
is formed of eight parts water, and oue of honey, boiled together3 “ idromellum, as
ober facultes vsen it ; it is a lycur bat we callen wort, and it is seyd of ydor, water, and
of hony, no3t bat hony gob ber to, for hony towcheb it but for it is swete as hony. It
is water of malt, mulsum.''

3 Previously to the existence of a standing stipendiary force, provision was made for
the defence of the realm, in any sudden emergency, by the law that every householder
should have in his dwelling a warlike equipment suitable to his means and station,
and should at certain fixed seasons present himself before the constables, or appointed
officers, with his accoutrements, for inspection. This was termed the munstre, mon-
strum, or armilustrium, in N. Britain the ‘⁴ weapon-schawynge,’' often mentioned in
the Scotch acts, and in later times in England‚ the muster. The most curious and ancient
ordinance to this effect is that passed at Winchester, 1285, 13 Edw. I. Stat. of Realm,
i. 97 ; but the existence of a similar scrutiny at an earlier period appears by the docu-
ments printed by Wats‚ M. Paris, Auctarium, addit. p. 230. Spelman cites Rot. Parl.
5 Heu. IV. regarding the monstrum or monstratio of men-at-arms; see also the ordi-
nance of Hen. V. in his statutes in time of war, “ de monstris publicis, seu ostenci-
onibus.” Upton. Mil. Off. 136. “ Muster of men, bellicrepa.'' CATH. ANG. Palsgrave
gives the verbs ‘¹ I muster, as men do yt shall go to a felde, ie me munstre. I muster,
I take the muster of men, as a eapytayne doth, ie fais les monstres. What place will
you sygne to muster your folkes in. Mustre of harnest men, monstre.” Δ
