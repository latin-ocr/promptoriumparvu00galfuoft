PREFAGE.

ΟΝ the completion of a long-promised contribution to English lexicography
some introductory noticcs seem indispensible, as an accompaniment to one
of the most valuable linguistio monuments of its class to be found in· any
European country. Whether we regard the Promptorium Parvuloruma
as an authentia record of the English language in the earlier half of the
fifteenth century, as illustrative of the provincial dialects of East Anglia,
or as explanatory of the numerous archaisms of a debased Latinity that
pervades early chronicles and documents, its value can scarcely be too
highly estimated. If, on the other hand, we take into consideration the
curious evidence which it supplies to those who investigate the arts and
manners of bygone times, it were difficult to point out any relic of learning
at the period equally full of instruction, and of those suggestive details
which claim the attention of students of mediaeval literature and antiquities
in the varied departments of archaeological research.

These considerations, not less than the great scarcity of the work,
whether we enumerate the MSS. hereafter described, or the few and often
mutilated copies of editions by the fathers of English typography, Pynson,
Julian N otary, and Wynkyn de WVorde, preserved to our days, were induce-

⁸ In the MS. at King’s College, Cambridge, the work is entitled, in the prologue,
“ Promptorius Parvulorum;” in Pynson's edition “Promptorius Puerorum;'' and in
that by Wynkyn de Worde “Promptuarium Parvulorum Clerieorum.” The last title
is doubtless most correct. Promptuarium in classical latinity signifies a store-room or
repository; in mediaeval times it denoted the department in a conventual or collegiato
establishment or the like, whence stores were dispensed, which in a monastery was
under the charge of the Cellarer. The author gives ‘⁶ Boterye; celarium, promptuarium3'’
p. 45; “ Celer; promptuarium3 Celerere of the howse; cellerarius, promptuarius;” p. 653
“ Spence, botery or celere; cellarium, promptuarium ;” p. 468. As illustrations of the
use of the term by mediaeval writers, I may mention the “ Promptuarium argumentorum
dialogice ordinatorum‚'’ Colon. 1496, “Promptuarium exemplorum,” appended to the
“ Sermones de Sanctis '³ printed by Julian Notary in 1510, “ Joh. Herolt Promptuarium,”
Nuremb. 1520, and “Jo. Piniciani Promptuarium Vocabulorum;” Aug. Vind. 1516.
The title, it may be observed, was adopted for a Latin-Frenoh and French-Latin vocabu-
lary, “Promptuarium Latinae Linguae‚'' printed at Antwerp by Plantin, 1564; and the

well-known series of medallion porti-aits first published at Lyons in 1553 is entitled
‘⁶ Promptuarium leonum Insigniorum.’'
