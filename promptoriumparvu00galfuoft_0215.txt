with at the time of his ordination, and therefore St. Stephen and St. Laurence, who
were deacons of the Church‚ are always represented as wearing this vesture. A very
interesting portraiture of the former will be found in a MS. of Xlth cent. Calig. A.
XIV. In early times the dalmatic was ornamented with longitudiual hands, called
clavi, which were either of gold, as in the illumiuation just mentioned, or purple;
“Dalmata, vestis sacerdotalis candida cum clavis purpureis.” Gloss. S. Isid. Orig.
Hence the epithets auroclavzcs, chrysoclavns, aud purpurfz clavatas. To these bands
were attached at intervals the playahr, as exhibited in the illumination of the Bible of
Charles the Bald at Paris, executed in the IXth century, engraved in Montfaucou
Mon. Franc. tom. i, and the splendid work published by the Comte Bastard. See also
the curious German Missal, Xth cent. Harl. MS. 2908. and the illumination in Cott.

of sacred ornaments given by Bp. Leofric to the chureh of Exeter about A.D. 1050,
occur “2 dalmatica, 3 pistel roecas.” Mon. Angl. i. 222. These last were probably
tuuieles, vestments appropriated to the order of subdeaeon, as was the dalmatic to that
of deacon; in effigies and representations that exist in England of ecclesiastice in pon-
εζῙίι-(ιίίόῑιε, both vestments are almost invariably exhibited. The Legate ottoboni or-
dained, A.D. 1268, that if any Prelate neglected to punish the immoral conduct of his
clergy, “Episcopus a dalmaticae, tunicae, et sandaliorum usu sit suspensus donec
duxerit quoe statuta sunt exequenda.'' Wilkins, Cone. xi. 5.

² DRAPYR. or party, ΜΞ. dapyr, or praty, Κ. Ρ. Palsgrave gives “ daper, proper,
mz'fflwn, yodin; dapyrnesse, propernesse‚ 7niyaotle7·t'e.“'

² A very usual sense of the verb to dare, in the old writers, is to gaze about, or stare;
Palsgrave gives “to dare, prye, or loke about me, je advisa alentonr. What darest
thou on this facyon, me thynketh thou woldest catche larkes ?''

‘¹ With woodecokkys lerne for to dare.'' Lydgate, Minor Poems,174.

The same signification has been assigned, by Tyrwhitt and the commentators on
chancer, to an expression occurring in the Shipman's Tale, the true import of which
appears above to be made clear. Dan John rallies the old merchant's wit'e on the slug-
gishuess of her sponse:

“an olde appalled wight,
As ben thise wedded men, that lie and dare,
As in a fourme sitteth a wery hare.''

Chaucer appears evidently here to use dare in the sense given to the word in the Promp-
torium of lying concealed, as an animal in its den, which is termed hereafter DWERE,
or (lowere. “Dilatescffi to biginne to dare. Lateo, to lurk.'' MED. Cotgrave gives
“ hlotir, to squat, ly close to the ground, like a dal-ing larke, or affrighted fowle.''
