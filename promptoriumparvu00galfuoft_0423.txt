In the Vocabulary of names of plants, Sloane MS. 5, is given ‘⁴ Amarusea calida,
Gall. ameroclze, Any. maithe ;” in another list, Sloane MS. 56, “ cheleye, i. mathe.'’
The camomile is still known by the appellation Mayweed3 Anthemio cotula, Linn.
Gerar-de describes the ‘⁴ May weed, wild cammomill, stinking mathes, or mauthen‚''
Cotulafaetffla, and observes that the red kind grows in the west parts of England
amongst the corn, as Mayweed does elsewhere, and is called “ red maythes, our London
women do call it Rose-a-rubie.‘' Ang.-Sax. mage‘oe, magffia, chamaemelum.

¹ Maak in the Craven Dialect still means a maggot. Dan. mak, madike, vermis.

2 “ Οοῐίρῃα, amake‚ or a yomanne.'‘ MED. In the edition of the Ortus in Mr.
&Vilbraham's library colleya is rendered “ a make, or a felowe.'' This term, as used
by Chaucer and other writers, has the signification of a mate, or fellow, a spouse‚ either
husband or wife. lt is said of the turtle dove in the Golden Legend, “ When she hath
lost her make, she wyll neuer haue other make.’' See Jamieson. A.-S. mana, consors.

³ The substantive a-cethe has occurred previously, p. 5, where the word has been
printed A-CETHEN, a contractior] appearing in the Harl. MS. over the final ᾗ. which,
however, is probably erroneous. The word is thus used in the earlier Wieliffite version :
“ Now than ryse‚ and go forth, and spekynge do aseethe to thi seruauntis ;'' in the
later, ‘¹ make satisfaccioun (satisfac servis tuis,” Vulg.) ii. Kings, xix. 7. In the later
version it occurs in i. Kings, iii. 14 : “ Therfore y swore to the hows of Heli that the
wickidnes of hys hows shal not be doon a-seeth before with slayn sacrifices and
3iftis ;’' in the earlier, “ schal not be elensid (eoepz'eturss’ Vulg.) See also Mark xv.
15. ‘⁴ Asethe, satisfaccz'O. To make asethe, sati-ffaceress’ cATH. ANG. “ Satisfactz'o,
(sic) to make a-sethe.'' ORTUs. Chaucer, in the Rom. of Rose, 5600, rendered “assez
..asseth ;‘' and in the passage previously cited from the Vis. of P. P. the line is printed
by Mr. VVright, ‘⁴ ifit suffise noght for assetz,'’ where he explains the word as syno-
nymous with the common law term, assets. Compare FULFYLLYN, or make a·cethe in
thynge bat wantythe 3 p. 182.

⁴ Some doubt may here arise as to the power of the contractioris in the MS. coue-
naunt, or cenaunt. Compare BREKE concnam, p. 50, and see the note on cssnawnte,

p. 108.
