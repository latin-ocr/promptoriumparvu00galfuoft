lxxxii APPENDIX.

Right Hon. J. H. Frere. It was subsequently in Sir John Fenn’s Li-
bra1·y‚ and passed into the hands of the Rev. -Jonathan Boucher, deceased in
1804 3 the Ms. was 111011 added to the late Mr. Dawson Turner's Norfolk
collectionis, aud at their dispersion it was purchased by the Hon. F. Wal-
pole of Rainthorpe Parlz, Norfolk. In regard to the numerous provin-
cialisms which occur in N orfolk, relies of the peculial· dialect with which
the author of the Promptorium declared that he was exclusively conver-
sant, it is not without interest to observe that a writer on agricultural sub-
jects, eighty years since, Mr. Marshall‚ has stated that, during a very short
time whilst pursuing his obsermtions, he registered in Norfolk nearly 1000
local expressions 01· deviations srom established language. He has given
those words only that relate to rura] affairs.a The late Mr. Goddard
-Johnson of Norwich made large collections of N orfolk words3 he infor-med
me that he had gathered 3000 or upwards which did not come under Mr.
Forby's notice.b His MSS. are, as I believe, in possession of ΜΓ. R.
Fitch, F.s.A., at Norwich.

Localisms of that County z by Edward Moor, F.s.A.” WVoodbridge,

The foregoing notices may doubtless appear tediously diffuse; and I have
thought it inexpedient to extend them by 311 enumeration of certain books,
those especially that relate 10 provincial dialect, cited in the following pageS.
The bibliography of early elementary works on Language would form an
instructive chapter in the History of English Literature3 it has been my
endeavor 10 offer some contribution towards a subject which 1110 disserta-
tions of Mr. Mayor, already cited, have in no slight measure tended 10,

’² Rural Eeonomy of Norfolk, vol. ii. p. 376, published in 1787.

b A short list of Norfolk provincialisms is given by Sir Thomas Browne in his ‘⁶ certain
Miscellany Traets‚'' Lond. 1684, p. 146. Mr. Halliwell points out a Vocabulary of the
xvth century written in Norfolk ; Add. MS. 12‚195. In Cullum's Hist. of Hawsted, 1784,
a list of Suffolk words may be found. Ι have frequently cited the ‘⁶ Points of good Hus-
bandry ” by Tusser, whose quaint verses, first published in 1557, are full of illustrations
of East Anglian dialect and of words oecurring in the Promptorium. I cannot omit to
mention a recent Version of the Song of Solonion in Norfolk dialect, by the Rev. Edward
Gillett, Vicar of Runham, a diligent collector of relies of the ancient vernacular of his
county.
