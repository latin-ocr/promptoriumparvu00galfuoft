to Preface, p xcviii. states that he had followed Wace‘s original more closely than
Peter Langtoft had done ς

“ For mayster Wace be Latyn alle rymes,
bat Pers ouerhippis many tymes.¹'

The verb ‘⁶ overhuppe‚'' to skip over, occurs in Vis. of Piers P. v. 8167, and 102395.
Gower uses ‘⁴ overhippetb ” in a like sense 3 it occurs also in writers of the XVIth Cent.
See Fryth's YVorks‚ p. 173 Udal, Hebr. c. 11. “ 1 overhyppe (or ouerskyp) a thyng
in redyng, or suche lyke, z'e trespasse. I overhyppe, Ie trespasse, and ie passe. Loke
you ouerhyppe (surpassez) nothyng, remember that the thynge that is well ‹loone is
twyse done, and the thyng that is yuell done muste be begon agayne.’' PALSG. Howell,
in the Grammar prefixed to Cotgrave's Dict. 1660, observes that ‘⁴ the reason why the
French o’re hips so many consonants is, to make the speech more easie and fluent.’'
To hip, signifying to hop, is still used in the North. See Brockett and Jamieson.

1 This verb is used in Vis. of Piers P. v. 9001 ; and by Lydgate, Boccace, v. 104, as
quoted by Mr. Halliwell in his Glossary, Coventry Mysteries‚ in which it occurs also in
the like sense of over-reaching, or over-bearing, p. 262. To lead, as it has been ob-
served p. 293, was used in the sense of carrying, as by Rob. Glouc. p. 416, “ lede and
bryuge,” where he speaks of loaded wains passing frozen streams during the severe
winter, A.D. 1092. To over-lead appears to be taken in the same manner as to carry
and to bear are used, denoting behaviour or demeanour. Palsgrave gives the verb “ I
overley, as a tyram, or myghty man ouerlayeth his subiectes, declared in I oppresse.’'

³ SYETTYK‘, MS. ouersettyn, K. ovyr settyn, S. “ I oversette, I overeome, declared
in Ι ouercome, I vaynquysshe or get the vper hande of one.’' PALSG.

⁴ A blank space has been here left by the scribe, the first syllable of the word
TYRVYN being apparently defective in the MS. from which the transcript was made.
'rmuvvssx' occurs hereafter in the sense of to weary, fatiqo ‚· but it seems very question-
