PREFACE. xxvii

some other writers affirm that he was an Englishman, who studied at
Oxford, and subsequently established himself in the University of Paris
early in the thirteenth century; in 1229 he became a professor at Toulouse,
but he returned to Paris, and probably died there soon aster 1250. He de-
dicated his treatise “ De mysteriis rerum que sunt in ecelesia,⁷’ of which
a notice will be found hereafter‚ to F ulke Basset, Bishop of London 1241-
1259. Mr. Wright has entered more sully into the history of John de
Garlandia in the Introduction to his poem De triumphis Ecclesia editcd for
the Roxburghe Club‚ and also in an introductory note in the edition of the
Dictionarz'us above mentioned.³ He expresses the conclusion, to which I had
been likewise led to incline, that these treatises should be assigned to the
early part of the thirteenth century.

The author of the Promptorium has drawn so largely upon these obscure
relies of mediaeval learning that the vexed questions connected with John
de Garlandia‚ and the precise period when he wrote these grammatical
treatises once so highly esteemed, are not devoid of interest. Upon this
point of literary history, however, the evidence has been conclusively
summed up by the Rev. J. E. E. Mayor in a dissertation in the Journal of
Philology which I have already cited.b Mr. Mayor observes that “the
patriotic attempt of Dom Rivet (Hist. Litt. de la F rance, viii. 83) to esta-
blish the French descent of J ohannes de Garlandia has been defeated by
the fairness of a later editor of that noble work, M. Victor le Clerc (ibid.
xxi. 369), who has also proved that Johannes lived, not in the eleventh
century, as Geraud maintained as late as 1837, but amid the intellectual
stir of the thirteenth. For, in a poem entitled ‘ De Triumphis Ecclesiae,’

portions of which have been printed by Mr. Wright‚0 he thus at once
acknowledges and repudiates his native land . . .

Gariandia may be found in numerous works on mediaeval literature: Fabric. Bibl. med.

above notieed was printed at Caen in 1508, under the title “Joh. de Garlandia Voca-
bularium sive vocum ad artes pertinentium expositio.''
