¹ It would be scarcely possible to define the garments, varied according to the fashion
of the day, from the Ang.-Sax. cyrtel, tunica, to the kirtle of erimson velvet provided
amongst the Parliament robes of Edward VL, to which this appellation was successively
applied. It denoted garments worn by both sexes3 R. Brunne speaks of the Empress
Maud as taking flight from Oxford ‘⁶ withouten kirtelle or kemse,'' p. 122; Chaucer
describes the “ kirtell of a light waget ’⁷ as part of the smart attire of Absolon, the parish
clerk; Miller's T. 3322. Walter de Bruge, canon of York‚ bequeathed in 1396, “y'.
yozwzam, cum j. curtill, etj. capucz'o.'' Test. Ebor. i. 210. The kirtle, as female attire‚
seems to have been a close-fitting garment, as appears in the description in Sir Launfal

of the two “gentyll maydenes—ilasced smalle‚ jolyf, and welle ;’' and Rob. Henrysoun,
l. Hen. VI. says, in the Garment of good Ladies,

“ Her kirtle should be of clean constance,
Lacit with lesum love.’'

John Payn relates in his letter to his master, John Paston, that in Cade's rebellion his
wife's dwelling was attacked, and the mob “ leste her no more gode but her kyrtyll and
her smook.'' Paston Lett. i. 62. As worn by men, the kirtle seems generally to have
been a short garment, and closely girt 3 but the ‘⁶ kirtell cle rou (se tao-tm·in‚'’ which formed
part of the state robes of the Knights of the Rath, was full and long-skirted. “ A kyrtelle,
ubi a cote. A cote, tunica, tunicella.” CATH. ANG. “ Kyrtell, a garment, corpset, suo-cot,
cotelle.” PALSG. “ Kyrtell, cottron.’' Boke to lerne Freneh, Pynson. Duwes, in the In·
troductory for to lerne French, written for the Princess Mary, gives “ the kyrtell‚ le cor-seh·
the kyrtell, la coitelette.” See Strutt’s Dresses, ii. 238, ed. 1842; Douce’s Illust. of
Shakespeare, Hen. IV. part ii. ; and Nares.

2 In the Wicliffite version this word is written “ cos, cosse‚'' Luke xxii. 48. R. Brunne
uses the verb “ cussed ;'' see also R. Gloue. p. 15. In the North it is still pronounced
cus, or kuss; see Craven Dial. and Brockett. A.-Sax. 008, osculum. Compare cus,
P ³ “ Catulus, a whelpe or a kytlynge.” omvs. “A kythynge (sic), catulus, catu-
laster.⁷’ CATH. ANG. In the earlier Wicliffite version, Deut. xxxiii. 22, is thus ren-
dered: “To Dan he seith, Dan, keetlyng of a lyon (catulus leonis, Vulg.) shal flowe
largely fro Basan.'' Palsgrave gives the verb to ⁰‘ kyttell as a eatte dothe, clmtonner.
Gossyppe, whan your eatte kytelleth, I praye you let me haue a kytlynge (ckattowy'
“ Ckatonaer, to kimie, or bring forth young eats. Caller, to kittle as a eat. Faire ses
pellis, to whelp, kittle‚ kindle, farrow,” &c. coTG. See Holland's Plutarch, p. 1793
Pliny, xxix. c. 4. Forby gives kiffling, a young cat. See Ash, the Cheshire Glossary,
and Jamieson.

⁴ This word occurs in the gloss, in the chapter on brewing by G. de Bibelesworth.
“Allumcl amy cele le frenole (bo kcx.)‘’ Arund. MS. 220, f. 300. In the Vision of

P. Ploughman it is said that glowing embers serve not the workmen in a winter's night
so well
