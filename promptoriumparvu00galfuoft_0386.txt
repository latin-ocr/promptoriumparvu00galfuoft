¹ ln the Vision of P. Ploughman this word signifies negligence, Fr. lacleesse.

“ The lord, of hus lacchese‚ and hus luther sleuthe,
By nom hym al that he hadde.”

See also line 4973. Chaucer says in the Persone's Tale, “ Then cometh lachesse, that is,
he that whan 118 beginneth any good werk, anon 118 wol for-lete and stint it ;'' and uses the
adjective “ laclie‚’' sluggish or dull3 Boec. B. iv. Gower observes that the first and chief
point of sloth 15 “ lacliesse,” which has this property, to leave all things in arrear. Conf.
Am. B. IV. See Jamieson, v. Lasche. Palsgrave gives the verb “ 1 latohe, I lagge, I
tary behynde my company, Ic tarzle, and Ie tst'tye‘ss'

‘² To latch, signifying to seize or catch, is a verb the use of which occurs in R. Brunne,
p. 120 ; the Vision of P. ploughman, 1279: Crede, 934 ; Cov. Myst. p. 29, &c. Chaucer
speaks of a “ nette or latch‚’' set by Love to snare birds. In Will. and the lverwolf it is
used in the sense of embracing:

‘⁶ Certes Sire bat is 501), sede Will'm banne,
And lepes li3tli him to, and laeches him in armes.'’ p. 163.

See also p. 25. In Arund. MS. 42, f. 17, b, it is related how the wood of aloes is ob-
tained, which grows on the mountain 10115, near a lake beyond Babylon, and falling into
the water, either from age and decay, or blown by the wind, the “ folk bat dwellen in bat
countre, or nere, casten 1181115, 01· 01181· 51853185, and laec-yn it. and so it is had.’⁷ Pals-
grave gives the verb ‘⁶ Ι 11118118, Ι catche a thyng that is throwen to me in my handes or
it fall 10 the grounde, Ie kappe. If I had latched the potte betyme, it had nat fallen to the
grounde.” Forby gives to latch as used in Norfolk in this sense; and Brockett states
that it is still retained in the Northern dialect. Ang.-Sax. laeccan, prehendere.

³ Cithara is rendered, in the Medulla, ‘⁶ a harpe,'' in 1118 Ortus “ a lewte ;”“’ and in the
latter occurs ‘⁴ citluzrz'so, to synge with a harpe.’' LAY HARPE seems here to denote the
instrument in its use as an accompaniment to the voice. Thus Chaucer says,

‘⁴ Thise old gentil Britons in hir dayes
Of diuers auentures maden layes,
Rimeyed in hire firste Breton tonge
Which layes with her instrumentys they songe.” Cant. Τ. 11,022.

888 Tyrwhitt's observations on the (lcrivation of the word lay. Ang.—Sax. ley, canticum.
As, however, satsaelaeaca. is defined by Papias, and other glossarists, to have the sense of
‘⁵ σι’(Ιαινα 7·«slae‘t·a,” lay harp 11185, possibly, imply the instrument used by the vulgar. The
instrument called symphonia, according to Uguitio, was a tamburinc.
