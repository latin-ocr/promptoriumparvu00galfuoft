¹ To job signifies in the East Anglian dialect to peck with the beak, or with a mattock ς
and is used in the former sense by Lestrange and Tusser, who directs boughs to be stuck
among runcival pease, upon which they may elimb (February's husbandry).

“ So doing, more tender and greater they wex.
If peacock and turkey leave jobbing their bex.”

HoHand, in his version of Pliny, B. x. e. 18, says that birds that “job and pecke holes
in trees,” are of the race of sprights, martius, or wood-peckers ; and speaks of ‘⁴ wood-
peckS, or jobbers‚'’ c. 29. ‘⁶ Becquer, to pecke or bob with the beake. Bet-quade, a
pecke‚job, or bob with a beake. Homer, to shake, jog, job, nod.'' “Sitta, a bird
called a nutjobber.'' GOULDM. Willughby‚ in his Ornithology, describes the nuthatch‚
or nut-jobber‚ Picus cinereus. Ash gives to job, in the sense of striking suddenly with a.
sharp instrument, as the word is used in Shropshire. See Hartshorne's Salopia.

2 In Domesday mention occurs of the joculator and the joculatm‘x reqis, T. i. f. 38, b.
and 162: Ang.-Sax. geogeIere, prestiyiator. The juggler and the minstrel are, as
VVarton observes, frequently eonfounded together. Music formed a part of the enter-
tainments provided by both, and it was not. perhaps, until the Xthh cent. that the
two denominations were properly distinguished. The juggler was called also TREGET-
TOWRE, a term which occurs in the Promptorium. His performanees were very varied,
comprising sleight of hand, trieks of all kinds, tumbling‚ and buffoonery. Strutt has
collected much information on this subject in his Sports, B. iii. c. iv. Chaucer, in the
third Book of Fame, seems to distinguish the jugglers from the minstrels and musicians,
and speaks of them as playing with magicians, “tragetours, and Phetonisses, charme-
resses‚'' &c.; but in the Rom. of the Rose he mentions minstrels and jugglers, as if their
performances were similar. He repeatedly alludes to the wonderful tricks which were
exhibited by them. “ Balatro, a yogelowre. Pantomz'mus, a iogeloure. Ραταπῑίαείεν,
id.'’ MED. “ To iugille‚⁴7'oculczri. A iuguler, yesstculator, «isc. ubi a harlott. A iugul-
ynge, ρεείίεῖιῐαοίο, jocamen.'' cATH. ANG. Horman says, ‘¹ The iugler carieth clenly under
his gubletfis, prestifsiator scite visum ludzflcat cum acceptabulis. A iugler with his troget
castis (vasi-amentis) deceueth mens syght.'' “ Iogelour‚ bacellevr. Iogelyng caste, passe,
passe. I ingyll. ie ioue de pos pas. Mathewe iogyled ye cleanest of any man in our
dayes. I iuggyll, διο. ie iouyle.” PALSG. Iu the Northumberland Household Book,
1511, a reward of 63. Sd. is appointed ‘⁴ to the Kyngs iugler, if he haue wone.'' See
