xxviii PREFACE.

Anglia cui mater fuerat, cui Gallia nutrix,
Matri nutricem praefero mente meam.

Another poem, ‘De Mysteriis Ecclesiae,' published entire by Otto,
commemorates the death of that ‘ Gemma pudicitiae . . . flos philosophiae,
Aula decens morum, redolens velut area florum,’ Alexander of Hales,
and is dedicated to Fulco Bishop of London. Now the irrefragable
doctor, as Johannes himself tells us, died in 1245, and Fulke Basset
retained his see, spite of the need and greed of King and Pope, from
1244 to 1259. Again, the triumph of the church which Johannes
commemorates at greatest length is the Albigensian crusade (De Tri-
umphis Ecclesiae, iv. v. vi), and in his Dictionary he tells us that he
saw at Toulouse, among other engines of war, that by which Simon de
Montfort was killed in 121ss There can no longer, 1 apprehend, be any
question as regards the period to which we should assign an author, in
whose productions‚ trifiing as their grammatical value may be, the anti-
quary will still find, and more particularly in his Dictionarius, a large
amount of recondite information.

6. Commentarius Curialium.-—This curious little work is found in a
collection of treatises principally by John de Garlandia, to whom it is also
there attributed, preserved in the Library of Caius College, Caliibridge.²²
I acknowledge with pleasure the kindness of the Master and F ellows in
entrusting to me that valuable MS„ which has proved of no slight advan—
tage in the present undertaking. The Commentarius, of which no other
copy has come under my observation, consists of six leaves3 it is written

¹² Catalogue of MSS. in Caius College Library, by the Rev. J. J. Smsth, No. 385. This
volume, “ Ex dono Magistri Rogeri Marchalle‚” contains, besides the Commentarius, “Dic-
cionarius Magistri Johannis de Garlandia, cum commento ;''' commencing, ‘⁶ Sacerdos ad
altare accessurus,'' &c.‚ treating of sacred vestments and ornaments; also of certain sciences,
grammar, logie, arithmetic, ecclesiastical and civil law, &c.—“ Accentarius ejusdem.
—Diccionarius alius ejusdem sub alia forma;'' the same as that printed by Mr. Wright
(Volume of Vocabularies, p. 120), and by M. Geraud (Docum. Inedits). ‘⁶ De misteriis
ecclesie per eundem Johannem de Garlandia;” commencing, “Anglia quo fulget:” also a
“ Compendium gramatice per eundem,'' in verse, commencing—“ Gramaticam trivialis apex
subjicit sibi fermo;” and “ Morale scolarium per eundem,'' in verse. In the Histoire Litte—
raire de 13 France, tom. viii. p. 96, three distinct dictionaries are attributed to John de Gar-
landia. of these, two, doubtless, are found in the volume here deseribed3 the third may
be the compilation of similar nature entitled Commentarius.
