rived the name by which the ancient Roman line of road is known which leads from the
great camp at Holme, on the N.W. Norfolk coast, towards waorth‚ in Suffulk, and
seems to have fallen into the line leading from Thetford to Stow-market. The greater
part of this road across the champaign parts of Norfolk is still called the Peddar Way,
doubtless because, like the Welshman’s Road in VVarwickshire and the parts adjacent,
the straight direction of its course caused it to be “frequented by itiner-ant traders. The
Peddar XVay may be traced upon the Ordnance Survey through nearly its whole extent.
It is also given in VVoodward's Map of Roman Norfolk, Archaeol. xxiii. 358. There is
also a vicinal road leading from Ightham, Kent, 10 Farnham, Surrey, which 15 0311οᾱ 1110

writing A.D. 1473, says, “ I most have myn instruments hyddur, whyche are in the
chyst in my chambre at Norwyche, whyche I praye you and Berney togedre joyntly‚
but nat seuerally, to trusse in a pedde‚ and sende them hyddur in hast.” Paston Letters,
V. 58. Tusser, in his list of husbandly furniture, given under September's husbandry,
enumerates “ a pannell and wanty, pack-saddle‚ and ped.'’ Ray speaks of dorsers as
1110 kind of peds or panniers used by the fish-jobbers of Lyme to bring their fish to
London. The original Glossary to Spenser, Sheph. Cal. Nov. V. 16, gives this expla-
nation ε “ A haske is a wicker ped, wherein they use to carrie fish.” It is owing to
this use of peds that, in Pynson’s edit. of the Promptorium, peddare is rendered pis-
carius. East Winch, in Norfolk, is called in old documents Pedder’s Wineh. “ A
