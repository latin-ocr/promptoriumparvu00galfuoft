¹ Gower, speaking of the vices that spring from original sin, says,

“ XVherof the first is dronkeship,
Whiche beareth the cuppe felauship.” Conf. Am. lib. vii.

‘⁶ Drunkechepe‚ ebrietas, τίηοῖεηςία, &e.” Harl. MS. 1002, f. 173, b.
² Chaucer makes repeated allusion to the somniferous qualities of the night-shade, or
dwale, the Atropa belladonna.

“ Arise (quod she) what haue ye dronken dwale Ρ
Why slepen γε Ρ it is no nitertale.” Court of Love.

A strange effect is attributed to this plant in a volume of miscellaneous collections,
once belonging to william W'orcestre, Sloane MS. 4, p. 2. “ For to take alle maner
of byrdys. Take whete, 01· other corne, and take guse of dwale, and menche be corne
ber yn, and ley yt ber be byrdys hawntene, and when they have eten ber of, bey shalle
slepe, bat ye may take bem with yowre handst' Higins. in the version of Junius’s
Nomenclator, gives “ Solcwzum letale, banewoort‚ dwall‚ or great nightshade.'’

³ “Amphihalus, a sclaveyn, a faldynge, or a dudd.'' MED. GRAMM. “ Lacerna est
pallium fimbriatum, a coule, or 3 dudde, or 3 gowne.'' Harl. MS. 2257. According to
the explanation given of birrus, the garment called a DUDDE. seems to have been a coarse
wrapper or dread-nought, probably the same as the Irish mantle made of raw wool, which
was in request in Englaud as late as the time of Charles L, as appears by the Custom-
house rates. “Birsrumjvestis pilosa seu ¹qrossa, a schypper's mauntel.’' ORTUS. F orby
gives to duddle up, or wrap up with clothe53 in the North, as well as other parts of
England, rags or clothes in general are called dudds; and Grose mentions asquare
in Stourbridge fair, where linen eloth was sold, called the duddery. See Jamieson.

⁴ By early writers this word is written very variously, but approaching more or less
to the Aug. Sax. dweorg, dweorh, nanus, which in the valuable fragment of AElsric's
Glossary, discovered by Sir Thomas Phillipps, in the Chapter Library, Woreester‚ is
written “dwaeruhff' Thus the gloss on G. de Bibelesworth‚ “Iao wey ester un petit
mym (dxx-eroum? Arund. MS. 220. In Lybeaus Disconus “dwerk'' occurs re-
peatedly, and in King Alisaunder we read of ‘¹ durwcs, the leynth of 311 elne.'' In
Synonym. Harl. MS. 1002, f. 173, occurs the word ‘⁴ dwarof‚'' and in Cath. Ang.
