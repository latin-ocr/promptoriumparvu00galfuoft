gives ‘⁴ a gaude, babiole,” which Cotgrave renders ‘⁶ a trifle, whimwham, guigaw, or small

order to its being loaded. ⁴¹ Iavele7·‚ to swathe or gavell corn 3 to make it into sheaves,

parts of England, and before drainage had been carried to any extent in the fenny
Eastern enunties, it was probably found in sufficient abundance to be commonly used
as fuel. Gerarde says that the M yrias Brabanticus, gaule‚ sweet willow, or Dutch
myrtle, grows plentifully in sundry places, as in the Isle of Ely, and the fenny places
thereabouts3 “ whereof there-is such store in that countrey, that they make fagots of it,
and sheaues, which they call Gaule sheaues, to burn and heat their oven5.⁷' He men-
tions also that it was used to give an intoxicating quality to beer or ale, as it is still
employed in Sweden.

³ ‘⁶ Gaumelle, applauda.” CATH. ANG. The composition of this sauce is thus given
in Arund. MS. 344 3 printed in Household Ordin. 441 3 and Warner’s Cookery‚ 65.
“ Gaunsell for gese. Take floure, and tempur hit with gode cowe mylke, and make hit
thynne‚ and eolour hit with saffron 3 and take garlek, and stamp 1111, 311(1 do thereto, and
boyle hit, and sew hit forthe.'' Caxton says, in the Book of Travellers, “ Nycholas the
mustard maker hath good vynegre‚ good gauselyn, yazcsaz'llz'ede.” The term is evidently
derived from “qaasse d'ail, a elove of garliek.” COTG. The Ortus explains “ applaudet
vel appluda, dicitur sorbitiuncula ex palez'sfacea. (a gaunselle,” MED.) This Latin word
properly means chaff of corn, or husks, but here is taken in reference to the ynasses, or
husk-like covering of the garlic.

⁴ Ray mentions gant, slim or slender, among South and East country words. Forby
gives ganty-gutted‚ lean and lanky; and Moore says that gant signifies scanty in Suffolk.
Ang.-Sax. 36113111, part. of the verb gewanian, tabescere. See SWONGE hereafter.

⁵ In the Eastern eounties gain signifies handy, convenient or desirable, and in the
North near, as ‘¹ the gainest road,'' which seems most nearly to resemble the sense here
given to the word. See Broekett, Jamieson, and Hartshorne's Glossary.
