written FY31N. To fie or fey now signifies in East Anglia, as in Craven and Hallam-
shire, to clean out, as ponds or ditches; it is thus used by Tusser, and also to express
the cleansing ofgrain.

“ Choiced seed to be pieked, and trimly well fy'd,
For seed may no longer from threshing abide.'’ August’s Husbandry.

“Escurem to scowre, fey, rinse, cleanse.'' COTG. Bp. Kennett, in his glossaria] coll.
gives “to fea, fey, feigh or fow, to cleanse or empty, as to fea a pond, a privy, ἃς.
Dunelm. Isl. Regia, mundare, elstera whence to feag, by metaphor, applied to whip-
ping or correetfflg, as, He feag'd him off.'' Lansd. MS. 1033. In the Wicliffite
version, Deut. xxiii. 13 is thus rendered, ‘⁴ hou sehalt bere a litil stake in be girdil, and
whanne 1)ου hast sete, βου schalt digge bi cumpa5‚ and 1)ου schalt hile wib erbe bingis
defied out, where βου art releuyd;'' in the Vulgate, “eyesm humo operies.'’ See
DEFrrx', and FEYAR.

¹ Johanna domina de Roos bequeaths‚ in 1394, ‘⁴ anam lonqam feletam de rosis de
pest, ὥθ’ Testam. Ebor. i. 203. “Nimbafflficscz'ola transversa ex (turo imum in
[anthe-o, quod est infronta- femz‘ncwu‘zn, a felet.” ORTUS. “Fyllet for a mayden's heed,
fronteau.” PALSG. “Fromcau, a fillet, frontlet‚ forehead eloth.’' COTG. In a letter
written about 1465 to Sir John Paston occurs the request of a lady, who “ wuld fayne
have a new felet.'' Pastor] Lett. lv. 176.

² F YLOWRE, or barbowrs crafte. MS. “A filoure, affilatorimn; to filoure, (cffilare.”
CATH. ΑΚΘ. The term affilatorz'um occurs with the signification of a hone, in the Usus
Ant. Ord. Cisterc. ο. 85. The implement so called seems to have been identical with
that now called a steel, in Frenchszcsil, which is rendered by Cotgrave “the steele,
wherewith a buteher whets his knives.’' A resemblance in form to the spindle or
spoole used in spinning was probably the origin of the appellations FYLOWRE,filarium,
and fusz'l. In the Boke of Curtasye a “ fylour '⁹ appears to signify a rod, as that upon
which a curtain may be hung, mowably, by means of rings. The word occurs in the
directions for the grooms of the chambers, regarding making the pallets, and two beds
of greater state, for lords,

“ That henget shalle be with hole sylour,
With eroehettes and loupys sett on lyour,
Tho valance on fylour shalle henge xw'th wyn,
iij curteyns stre3t drawen withinne.” Sloane MS. 1986.
