¹ “ A grise, porcellus, et cetera nbi a swyne.'' CATH. ANG. “ Mai-cassin, a young wild
boare, ashoot, or grice.’' COTG. Grys occurs repeatedly in this sense, in the Vision of
Ρ. Ploughman‚ 450, 2182, 4353 t in the glossary, Mr. Wright refers to the story of Will
Gris in the Lanercost Chron. Skinner cites Gouldman's Dict. as the sole authority for
the word grice, and proposes as an etymon Belg. griis, cinereus. The word appears to be
now obsolete‚ or retained only in the diminutive griskin. Bp. Kennett in his gloss, coll.
Lansd. Ms. 1033, gives, “grioe, a pig: Island. griis, vel gryS‚ saccula ,· '’ and cites the
Yorkshire Dial. p. 42, and Douglas’s Virgil. See Jamieson.

⁹ Neccham, in his treatise de nominibus utensilium, writes as follows respecting female
oostume: ‘¹ Camisz'a sindonis, vel serici, vel bissi, ‘materiam sorciatur (z'. capiat.) Pe-
mda (pane) mantelli sit ex scisimis (yrz‘s)‚vel experiolz's (ekureus), sive scureclz's, vel ea:
cuniculis, vel ex [aeronibus (lee2·u1zs); cujus urta (penate) sit ex subflauo, ‹ft-cf’ Cott.
MS. Titus, D. xx. with an inter-linear French gloss. This kind of fur is mentioued by
John de Garlandi'a, in his Dichonary, among the more costly kinds: “Palmaria-
carius vendunt cis-imum (αἰ. scimum) et urlas de saballino ; ” upon which the following
gloss is given, “ cisimus est illud quod dicitur Gallice vare, et yrt's.” Docum. Inedits,
Paris sous Philip le Bel, App. 591. The esteem in which it was held appearsfrom Μ.
Paris, who states in his account of the honorable reception of the Tartar envoys by
Innocent IV. A.D. 1248, “dedit eis vestes pretiosissimas, quas rohas vulgariter appel-
lamus, cle escarleto praeelecto, cum penulis et surcariis cle pellibus variis cisz'morwnst' It
is not easy to ascertain with precision what is the animal that supplied this fur ; it appears
to be described by Gesner as the M us Ponticus, or Venetas, commonly called varius, and
the fur of which was termed by the Germans Grauwerck. The terms syris and vair
seem, indeed, to be frequently used as synonymous, but many authorities may be cited
from which a distinction is apparent. Much curicus information on this subject, and on
the use of costly furs in general, has been given by Dueange, in the first dissertation
appended to Joinville. Chaucer describes the sleeve of the monk as “purfiled at the
hond with gris '’ of the finest quality. Cant. Tales, Prol. 194. Mention occurs of “ grey
and grys ’⁹ in Vis. of P. Ploughman, 10,065. See Jamieson, v. Griece. In the Invent.
of the Wardrobe of Heu. V. taken 1423, are enumerated various gai-ments “suri-ez de
cristigrey ς ” probably a variety of [sris.
