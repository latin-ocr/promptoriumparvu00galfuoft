Chaucer mentions the gipon as part of the attire of the knight, Cant. T. Prol. v. 75,
and Knight's T. v. 2122. A full account of the jupon, or guippon, will be found in Sir
S. Meyrick's Treatise on Military Gal-ments worn in England, Archaeol. xix. 236. In
Ly beans Diseonus the garment is termed a ‘¹ gypell.’' In N. Britain a kind of short
cloak for women, as also a wide coat, is termed a jupe.
