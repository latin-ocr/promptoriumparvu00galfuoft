¹ The pectoral, as a sacred ornament used by the prelates of the Christian church,
appears to have derived its origin from the jewelled breast-plate of the Jewish high-
priest, the λογεῖον των κρίσεων, οι· rationale judicii, according to the Vulgate, Exod.
xxviii. 15, rendered in the earlier Wicliffite version ‘⁴ the breest broche of dom‚'' in the
later ‘⁸ the racional of doom.” It was worn attached to the breast os the chasuble, and
although never, as it appears, in general use, yet many examples present themselves in
England. As regards the obscure subject of the early use of the rationale, much infor-
mation may be gained from the authors cited by Ducange. It is minutely described in
an ancient inventory of pontifical ornaments at Rheims, given by Marlot in the Hist. of
that see, and appears to have closely resembled the Jewish breast-plate‚ being formed of
1⁶2 stones, whereon the names of the 12 sons of Israel were inscribed, fixed upon cloth
of gold, and attached by means of chains over the shoulders, whereupon also there were
two stones called “ camayeux,¹' in imitation of those which were worn by the high-
priest. A second rationale for less solemn occasions is described in the same document,
which resembled less closely the Jewish ornament : it was formed of one stone of un-
usual brilliancy and size, called ⁴‘ camayeu‚’' around which were set 4 emeralds, aud as
many balais rubies. A representation of this remarkable ornament may be seen in the
plate given by Du Bouchet, in the Hist. of the House of Courtenay, p. 174, which
represents the sepulchral effigy of Robert de Courtenay, Archbishop of Rheims, who
died 1323. The most remarkable representation which exists in England is afforded by
the effigy placed under Prince Arthur’s chantry in Worcester cathedral, and attributed
to Bp. Godfrey Giffard, 1268—1301. The rationale here appears as a square plate
upon the breast of the chasuble, with a quatrefoil in the centre, and set with eight
gems. This ornament appears in England chiefly during the XIIIth cent. See the
seals of Joceline, Bp. Bath, and John, Bp. Wiuch. 1205 3 of Eustace. Bp. Lond. 1222,
Walter, Bp. Carlisle, 1223, Ralph‚ Bp. Heref. 1239, Sylvester, Bp. Carlisle, 1946,
Henry, Bp. Lincoln, 1300; and the effigy of Bp. Laurence‚ at Rochester, who died
1274. In the Invent. of St. Paul's‚ 1295, given by Dugdale, several chasubles are
described as furnished with the pectorale, formed of gold, or eloth of gold, set with
gems, Its use was not entirely abandoned at a later period : it appears upon the seal
of Richard, Bp. Lincoln, 1420, and in the Invent. taken at VVinchester cathedral at the
Dissolution, occur a pectoral of gold ; another partly of gold, and six of silver gilt, all
garnished with stones. Strype's Mem. of Cranmer, App. p. 25. The term pectoral
occasionally desig-nates an ornament of the eope, as in the Invent. taken at St. Paul’s‚
and given by Dugdale, in which mention occurs of a “ capa, cum Petro et Paulo z'n
pectorali: (sapa—cam rotundis pectoralibus aurffriyii3‚’' διο.

2 In the Eastern Counties‚ according to Forby and Moor, a pannier, such as serves
to carry provisions to market, is termed a ped, the market in Norwich, where wares
brought in from the country are exposed for sale, being known as the ped-market, and
a dealer who transports his wares iu such manner is tei-med a pedder. Hence is de.
