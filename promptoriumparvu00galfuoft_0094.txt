(32 ) 6105531131 Collections by Bishop Kennett.—The Glossary appended
by the learned Bishop of Peterborough to his ⁴‘ Parochial Antiquities,'' of
which the first edition appeared in 1695, is highly to be appreciated. I
would invite attention to his valuable collection of obsolete and provincial
expressions preserved 111 the British Museum, in Lansdowne MS. 1033,
which Ι have cited frequently in the following pages. This large compila-
tion is wholly distinct from the printed Glossary, and seems well deserving
of publication 3 independently of the value of the etymologica-l sugges-
110115, there can be little doubt that numerous dialectic words are here to
be found, which have subsequently been wholly disused and forgotten.²²

(33.) Glossary of Archaic and Provincia] Words, by the late Rev.
Jonathan Boucher, Vicar of Epsom.—A portion of this work, containing
the letter A, was printed after the death of the author in 1804 by Sir F.
Morton Ede113 Lond. 1807, 410. It was entitled “ A Supplenient to Dr.
Joliiis01i’s Dictionary, or a Glossary of Obsolete and Provincial Words.''
In 1832 another edition commenced under the editorial care of the late
Mr. Hunter, author of the Hallamshire Glossary, and of Mr. Joseph Ste-
venson. Two parts were published in 410. containing Boucher's Introduc-
tory Essay, with the Glossary as far 35 1110 word “ Blade.'’ Mr. Boucher's
MSS. remained in Mr. Hunter's hands, at the dispersion of his libi-ary,
after his death in 1861, 111050 6105531131 001100110115 were purchased by Mr.
Russell 81111111, and sold by him 10 Mr. Halliwell; they were again sold at
Messrs. Sotheby's 111 1864, and came into the possession, as I believe, of

Mr. C. E. Hodgkin, West Derby, Lancashire.

(34.) “ Glossary of words, Phrases, 820. in the works of English au-
thors, particularly Shakespeare and his contemporaries;⁷' by Archdeacon
Nares—This valuable work, which I have often cited as explaining ar-
chaisms of an earlier period than that set forth in the title, is replete with
0011011511111511-3110115 of early language and literature. It was first pub-
lished 111 1822, Lond. 410.; 3 second edition, considerably augmented‚ was

a The Bishop died in 172& these collections were probably compiled towards the
close of tho previous century, and not long after the earliest printed notice of local words,
naniely that puluis-hed by Ray as early as 1654, but brief and meagre as compared with

the MS. 6105501)- abore cited.
