¹ The origin of the curfew 111 England is generally ascribed to the Conqueror, by
whom it was imposed in token of servitude, but the assertion seems to rest on no suf-
ficient authority, and no mention of the usage occurs in the Stat. de nocturnis custodiis,
Ancient Laws and Instit. i. 491. Dr. Henry observes that the eustom prevailed,
at the time of the Conquest‚ in Framce, and probably in all the countries of Europe,
and was intended merely as a precaution against fires, at a time when cities were con-
structed chiefly of wood. It has been stated also that the custom was abolished by
Henry II. The Statutes of the City of London, 13 Edw. Ι. enjoin that no one shall
be found 111 the streets ‘² apres coeverfzc pvrsone‘ ὰ Seia& illm-tyn le 97·(7'7777t.'' Stat. of
Realm, i. 102. Conrre feu, or cwgfou in Franee was rung at 7 in the 01011108, but in
some places at a later 110111 10 5111110101, and there was also a bell at daybreak. See
Pasquier, iv. 18, and Menage. In England the hour of ringing the curfew was eight,
ll'ats‚ however, 81105 0100 as the hour in 5111110101; that 110111 15 50 named in “the
Merry Devil of Edmonton,“'and it was the customary time in Scodand, as appears
by Aet Parl. 13 James I. 1419, but subsequently was altered to ten. The usage of the
curfew is still retained in the Universities‚ and many towns and villages in England, as
is likewise the custom of ringing a bell at day-break, or four o'elock. At Lynn, where
the Promptorium was compiled, the largest bell of the principal churches is still tolled
at six, both morning and evening, and serves as a signal to labourers and artizans. The
salutatio angyelica, commonly called the (177ῃεῖ775, was recited daily morning and evening,
“ad pulsationem 75777'77297'7'ss’ an institution ascribed to St. Bonas-entare, but more
probably, as Ducange observes, to Pope John XXII. at the Council of Sens, 1320.
In the Statutes of Lichfield Cathedral‚ it is ordered as follows: “Est antem iynim-
