legihle hand, on parchment and paper mixed3 imperfect. At the begin—
ning· is the prologue, “ Hec est regula‚'’ as above 3 at the end, “ Explicit
Medulla Gramatice.” Late fifteenth century.

5. Harl. MS. 2181. Another copy in abridged form, carelessly written
on parchment3 late fifteenth century.

6. Harl. MS. 2257. A neatly written MS. sse text seems to resemble
that of the Ortus Vocabulorum, but it contains much that is not found in
that book, nor in the Medulla in its ordinary form3 possibly an abridge-
ment of this dictionary. This is perhaps the most valuable MS. of its kind
in the British Museum, but it is unfortunately imperfect. It commences
with the word ‘⁴ Boletus est genus fungi‚'’ and ends with “ Zona.'‘

7. Harl. MS. 2270. Attributed in Catal. Harl. MSS. vol. ii. p. 635,
· to Galfridus Grammaticus, and on the first leaf is written, but not by
a contemporary hand,—“ Medulla Grammaticae Galfridi.” On paper;
beginning ‘⁸' Hec est regula generalis,” &cn The first word in the dic-
tionary is “ Alma ;” the last is ‘⁴ Zozimus . . . Explicit Medulla Gramatice
N oviter.''

8. Harl. MS. 6514. Imperfect3 the explanations in Latin are given
more fully than in some other copies,

9. Add. MS. in Brit. Mus. 24‚640. This copy, in small folio, written on
parchment, is unfortunately imperfect at the beginning and the end.a It
is otherwise in fine condition, written in a neat- legible hand3 probably not
much later than the middle of the fifteenth century. There are plain
rubricatcd initia] letters ς and some marginal additions occur which seem to
be by a nearly contemporary hand. It begins with the word ‘⁶ Abhomina-
rium,⁷’ and the concluding word is “Hec mantica, a male.” It was
purchased from ΜΓ. J. O. Halliwell in May, 1562, and, as stated in a
note written by his hand, it had been presented to him by Mr. Hunt of

Stratford-on-Avon. b

ὃ On the fly-leaf at the end there is the following verse :-—-
Anno Milleno quadringentesimo trino
Bellum Salopie fuit in Mag. nocte marie.
The fatal battle of Shrewsbury was fought on July 23, 1403 3 the festival of St. Mary
Magdalene here referred to being July 22.

b The entry by Mr. Halliwell is as follows: ‘⁶ This MS. was given to me by Mr. W. Ο.
Hunt of stratford on Avon, April ‘23 (Shakespeare's birthday) 1862. 1 accepted it on
the condition that Ι was to be at liberty to sell it, adding the proceeds to the Shakespeare
fund.—J. O. 11.”
