ordei. In old French malt was called qm, or maest, according to Roquefort 3 buz Pais-
grave gives the word ‘⁶ grout that serueth to brewyng. in Fraunce there is none vsed.''
G. de Bibelesworth, who wrote in the reign of Edw. Ι. gives a curious account of the mode
of brewing‚ in which ‘⁶ grout ’' occurs as a gloss on the word ‘⁶ benioest' which is not
found in the glosmries, and may possibly be a barbarous compound of bere, a drink, or
ber, δέη-16], and ciffum, which, according to Bnrel, was the Gaulish appellation of beer.
The term grout is not used in the detailed account of brewing given by Harrison in the
description of England, Β. 11. c. 6, Holinsh. i. 169. In the North, according to Celes,
Ray, and the Craven Gffissary, grout signifies wort of the last running. Bp. Kennetz
gives the following note “ Grout, growt: in Leicestershire the liquor with malt infused
for ale and beer, before it is fully boiled, is called grout, and before it is tunned up in the
vessel, is called wyrt, or wort. Ang.-Sax. grut, 710ιά cervisia. They have in the NVest a
thick sort of ale, which they call grem-ale, and it is in most places a common proverb, as
thick asgrowt. Kilkm, grauwt, condimentum cerevisiae.” Lansd. MS. 1033. The term
was not, perhaps, exclusively confined to denote farinaceous mixtures for the purpose of
brewing3 thus land in Addington‚ Surrey, was held by the serjeanty of making in an
earthern pot in the royal kitehen, on the day of coronation, a mess called “ diligrout‚''
as stated by Blount‚ in his Jocular Tenures, p. 50. In the Plac. Cor. 39 Hen. III.
it is called ‘⁶ le mess de (syron,'' or, if compounded with fat, it was termed “mau-

i( 2 2·nu11>.'’
P⁸4J111 the Wicliffite version the following use of this verb is found, Jos. x. 21 ι “ No
man was hardi to gracche (eber to make pryuy noise, mutire, Vulg.) a3enus be sones of
Israel.'¹ Sir John Maundevile speaks of “the welle that Moyses made with his hond
in the desertos, when the people grucehcd, for thei fownden no thing to drynke.” It
is said in the Golden Legend, that ⁴⁴ when the herte is full of grace, hym oughte not
grutche by impacyenee.’⁷ In the Vision of Piers P. and Chaucer's Works, the word
occurs frequently. “Fremeo, i. mecrmnoasre, to grudge. Murrum-0, to grutche. Sa-
surrium dicitur nmrmuraho, a grutchynge.'' ORTUS. ‘⁴ To gruche, dedi-qnari, 'umr-
