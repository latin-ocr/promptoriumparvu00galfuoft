is given a representation of the cole-staff (mumma) used for bearing a burden between
two persons, p. 135; and again at p. 113, where it appears as used by brewers to carry
to the cellar the newly-made beer in ‘⁶ soes‚'' or tubs with two handles (labra), called
also cowls. In Brand's Popular Antiquities‚ ii. 107, will be found an account of the
local custom ot* riding the cmvi-staff, or stang.

¹ At the period when the Promptoriuni was compiled, calculations were usually made
by means of the (chamas, or counting—board‚ and counters, which were chiefly the pieces
of base metal to which the name of Nuremburgh tokens has commonly been given. The
“augrim 5101105” mentioned by 011311001- in the Miller's Tale, where he describes the
clerk of Oxford's study, probably served the same purpose. Palsgrave gives ‘¹ counters

A curious representation of the connter-tahle cceurs in drawings of the time of Edward
II. in Sloane MS. 32183. In a letter from Margaret Pastori to her husband, about 1459,
regarding some alterations in his house, is the following passage: ‘⁵ Ι have take the
