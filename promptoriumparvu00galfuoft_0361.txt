in the Gate of Tongue5‚ p. 178, says that “ one made to avoide his countrey wandereth
abroad‚ and gaddeth and ietteth up and downe, vayatur.'’ Ed. 1633. “ To jet up and
down, vayor, spatior, tolutatim incedere. To jet like a lord, incedo. To jet to and
fro, volae'lo. A jetter, yradarius.” GOULDM. Compare GETTYN and GETTARE.

¹ The Gloss on Gaut. de Bibelesworth rendere “ese-larem, en ychele.'’ Arund. MS.
220, f. 300, b. In Gawayn and the Grene Kny3t, 732, occurs the word ‘⁴ iisseikkles: ”
and by Chaueer it is written “iseickle.'' “Stiria est putta fluens, vel cadens οοπῃεῖαία,
a nykle.” MED. MS. CANT. “ Stiria est yzctcafi-z'yore concreta pendeus yufttutz'mque stillans,
a yokle.” ORTUS. “Stiriam, hysehykylle.'' Vocab. Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII. “An 130-
kelle, stiriam.'''cATn. ANG. Grose gives iceles as a word used in the North3 and it is
given in the Graven dialect, as likewise ice-shackles3 see also Brockett, v. Iee-shoggle‚

² An island in the Severn‚ about four miles N. of worcester, called by Flor. WVigorn.
‘⁴ Bevereye‚'' and at the present time Bevere‚ served as a retreat to the people of that
city when it was burned by Hardicanute, A.D. 1041, on their resisting the payment of
tribute. See the Sax. Chron. Langtoft gives a relation of the circumstances.

“ But 1³0 bat fled wil> ber godes to be ilde of Seuerne,
And bat wer in be ilde duelled ber for drede,
Untill be Kyng turned, and his wrath ouer 3ede.’' R. Brunne, p. 56.

In another passage, p. 151, he relates that Richard Coeur de Lion took possession of two
islands in the mediterraneam, one “that ilde hight Labamare‚’' which is described as
situated in the straights of Messina ; and another ‘⁴ ilde ” called “ Griffonie,” meaning,
perhaps, Sicily. In Kyng Alisaunder the word “ ydle‚'’ as printed by Weber, seems to
be the same word, varying by local pronunciation.

“ Euerych ydle, euerych contrey,
He hath y-soughth, par ma fey;
An ydle he passeth y—hote Perfiens.” 5908.

³ The verb to imp, Aug-sax. impan, inserere, and the substantive imp, a graft, scion,

“ Of what kynd of ympe in gardein or in frith
Ymped is in stocke, fro whence it came
It sauourith euer, and is nothyng to blame.‘' Hardyng's Chron. c. 98.
