used for pointing, in the early instruction of children: thus Palsgrave gives “festue to
spell with, ‚testetu'’ Occasionally the word is written with c or k, instead of t, but it
is apparently a corruption. “Festu, a feskue, a straw, rush, little stalk, or stick, used
for a feseue. Toucke, a fescue; also, a pen, or a pin for a pair of writing tables.''

¹ Chaucer uses the word fetise, and fetisely‚ in this sense; it is apparently derived
from the old French fetis, or ficiteis. Palsgrave gives “featysshnesse‚ pmpernesse,
sectctz'se;’' as also the synonymous word “ ferite, or proper os makyng, ¹qodz'n, ,csocliness

taken from the French, “fe'aulte'‚ Ῑέατιίέ;]ῐ(ἷέῐίίέ, soi, constanceJ’ ROQUEF. It is
commonly taken for the oath of allegiance in the feudal system :

“ When thise Bretons tuo were fled out of this lond,
Ine toke his seaute of alle that lond helde.” R. Brunne.

³ In the wieliffite version occur the following passages: “he that seith to his
brother, Fy (al. fugh) schal be gilty to the counsell.” Matt. v. 22. “And as thei
