¹ Half a bushel is given hereafter as the same measure which is here intended; and
the terni EY3TYNDELE seems to be derived from its being the eighth part of a coom, or
half quarter, which has already occurred, COWME of θοι-ΗΘ, cumba. Compare DELE, and
HALVUNDEL. Ang.-Sax. daehpars. Bp. Kennett, in his glossarial collections‚ Lansd.
MS. 1033, mentions another local name for the same measure, “a tolet, the measure
of half a bushel, Kent 3 some say two sats. SaX. sat, or faet, was the same measure as our

eck.''

p 2 AgarL MS. The word elde, still retained in the Northern dialect, occurs often as a
substantive in old writers. Thus in the Wicliffite version, 3 Kings, xv. 23, is thus
rendered, “Asa hadde aehe in feet in be tyme of his eelde 3²⁵ and it is commonly used
in Piers Ploughman. See Chaucer's description of “ Elde ’¹ personis-led, Rom. of Kese„
“ Senectus, helde; senex, haldman.⁷’ Vocab. Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII. ⁰¹ Elde, senecta,

³ In Norfolk, according to Forby, the elder tree is still called eldern; “ sambucus, an

“ Ales de sueau (of ellern‚ MS. Phill. hildertre, Arund. MS.) lemset sulzeaus,
Vn ‘ntanyer ke est bons et heaus (wib milke.)”

In Worcestershire the elder is termed ellern‚ and Piers Ploughman speaks of it thus:

‘¹ Impe on an essere,

And if thy appul be swete,
Muchel merveille me thinketh.'' Vision, line 5471.

“ Um sam, an ellir tree.'’ Harl. MS. 219. Aug-Sax, ellarn, ellen‚ sambucus. In the
North the alder is called an eller‚ whence several names of places, as Ellerbeck, Eller·
burn, διο. in Yorkshire, are derived. Ang.-Sax. alr, alnus. “An ellyrtre‚ alnum
alnetum est locus ubi crescunts' CATH. ANG. In the Ortus is given another name of the

elder, ‘⁶ sambucus, burtre, or hydul tre.''
