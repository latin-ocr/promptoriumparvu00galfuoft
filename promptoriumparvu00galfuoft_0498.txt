diminutive person is called in the North a picht‚ and the lower orders still designate by
this term the supposed race of pigmies. Several remarkable relations illustrative of the
ancient popular belief in such supernatura} beings are given by the old historians, such
as that of the priest Eudorus, recounted by Giraldus, Itin. Camb. i. c. 8 ; the account
of the demons called in England Portunz', and in France Neptuni, according to Gerv.
Tilbur. Ot. Imp. Dec. iii. c. 61 ; the extraordinary tale of Rad. de Coggeshale re-
specting the boy and girl discovered near Wolpit, in Suffolk‚ and kept for a long time
by Sir Rich. de Galae, at wikes, which are described as having had the human form,
but wholly of a green colour, and as having been led by the sound of bells to emerge
into the rays of the sun from their land beneath‚ where twilight reigned, and everything
was green. Roy. MS. 13 A. XII. f. 73, v0. See Keightley's Fairy Mythology‚ and
compare ΕΜΓ, snpra, p. 138.

² ‘⁴ A pyke ofa scho, or of a staffe, rostrum.” CATH. ANG. Liripipium usually
denotes the hood with a long appendage, which, as Knyghton describes it, was twisted
around the head; but here it seems to be synonymous with poleine, or cracowe‚ the
proper appellation whereby the singular long-peaked sboe‚ which was in fashion during
the early part of the XVth cent., was known. These terms are supposed to be derived
from the fashion having been introduced from Poland, and Cracow, its metropolis,
possibly by some of the suite of Anne of Bohemia, Queen of Ric. II. Will. Malmsb.
however, states that among the effeminate habits of the times of Rufus, “usus cal-
ceorum cum arcuatis aculeis inventus .·” the pouleiues were also much in vogue in France
during the reign of Charles V. and forbidden in 1340 and 1365. The monk of Emsham,
in the Life of Rich. II. ed. Hearne, p. 53, relates the indignity that was shown in the
diocese of Oxford to the messenger of Abp. Courtenay, in 1:384, when he was compelled
to eat the prela'te's mandate, seal and all ς but in retaliation the Archbishop's adhe-
rents ⁴¹ sciderunt cracowys de sotularibus aliquorum de familiti Epi. Ooeon. et ipsos
cracowis edere coyerurzt.” In a treatise on the virtues of plants, written about the
same time, the seed, or cod, of the Cas-sia fistula is described as of the “ gretnesse of a

the period when the Promptorium was compiled such peaked shoes were worn of an
extravagant length. and the fashion was restricted by the statutes of apparel, during the
reign of Edw. IV. when the length of ‘⁵ pykes of shoen or boteux '' was cut down to
two inches. See Parl. Rous, V. 505, 566; Stat. of Realm. Although no early sump-
tuary statute is found whereby the use of such shoes was restricted to knights or
persons of estate, they are mentioued repeatedly, as if accounted specially a part of
knightly equipment. Thus in the description of the comely attire of Sir Degore, it is
said, “His shone was croked as a knighte.” v. 700. This Romance is supposed to
have been written early in the XIIIth cent. The young Torrent of Portugal is de-
scribed as craving knighthood from the King of Provens, who bids him engage in a feat
of arms, “ and wyn the shoue‚” v. 1117 ς having acquitted himself manfully, he comes
at “myd-mete‚⁷’ and presents himself at the deis in his squire’s habit, “withoute
couped shone‚” to claim the guerd0n3 v. 1193. Compare this passage with Vis. of
Piers Pl. v. 12,Ο99, where a description occurs of one who comes, as if to a just, after
