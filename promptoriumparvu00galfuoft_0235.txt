to drink drovy or troubled water, then for to drink water of the clere well.’' ‘⁶ Drovy,
turbidus, turbulencus.” cun. ANG. ‘⁶ Turbidus, troubli, drobli‚ or dark.'' MED. GRAMM.
‘⁰ Tuo-hulmum, i. non lucidus, drouy.’' ORTUS. Bp. Kennett‚ in his Glossarial Col-
lections, Lansd. MS. 1033, gives “dravy οι· druvy, Bor. druvy, Northumb. drevy‚
thick, muddy as the water is. Sax. drefend, turbiclus.” Forby mentions drovy‚ used
iu Norfolk as an epithet of loathing, on account of filthiness of the person. Ang. SaX.
drof, coenosus.

¹ Higins, in his version of Junius's Nomenclator, renders “ vannus, a van wherwith
corne is clensed from chaffe and drosse against the wind.” Ang. Sax. dros, snex, sordes.
At Hengrave Hall, in Suffolk, in 1604, is entered in account a delivery “ for the swine,
of dross wheat.'‘ Hist. of Hengrave, 207.

² This term, implying difficulty of speech, or stuttering‚ has not been met with else-
where. The Ortus renders “traulzcs, a ratelere,'' a word equally unnoticed by Glos-
mrists, which occurs also in Cath. Ang. “ To ratylle, lrcmla‘re ,· a ratyller‚ traulus.’'

³ In the Anturs of Arther, where a description occurs of the King and his court
going forth to the chace, it is said,

“ The dere in the dellun,
Thay droupun and daren.⁷’ Ed. by Mr. Robson, p. 3.

⁴ “ Turbidus, troubli, drubli, or darke.'' MED. In the Ortus and Cath. Angl. drouy
occurs in the same sense; Jamieson gives droubly and drumbly; and the verb to
drumble, signifying to be confused, is used by Shakespeare. See Nares.

⁵ This word is used repeatedly by Chaucer, and occurs in Piers Ploughman and the
Wicliffite version.

“ Irous Cambises was eke dronkelew,
And ay delighted him to ben a shrew.

” Sompnoure's Tale.

Horman uses the word ‘⁴dronk1eu, dronkeleu.” In a curicus treastise 0110bstetrics
of the latter part of the XVth century, Add. MS. 12, 195, are particular instructions for
the selection of a nurse, among whose recommendations are “bat sche be wysse and
well a-vyssyd, and bat sehe lof be chylde‚ and bat sche be not dronkeleche.”
