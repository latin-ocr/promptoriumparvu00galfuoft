³ The invention of combustible or explosive eompounds for purposes of war dates from
remote antiquity in the East. Their origin and nature has been sully investigated by H.
M. the Emperor of the Freneh, in his remarkable work on the History of Artillery; we may
refer also to the treatise Da Fen. Greqeozk, by ΝΜ. Reinaud and Fare, and to the Essai
sur le Fau (ἕν-ἑφθοῖς, by M. Lalanne. The term Wild Fire, here given as synonymous with
Greek tire, occurs repeatedly in the Romance of Coer de Lion, written about t. Edw. Ι.
The dromond captured by Richard between Cyprus and Acre was laden “ with wylde t'yr
and other vytayle;” line 24633 wild fire was projected by tubes called ‘¹ trumpes ;'’ at
the siege of a city were used “ arweblast of vys,'' with quarreIS‚ staff-slingS, and trebuchets‚
and the besiegers “blewe wylde fyr in trumpes of gynne;” line 5229. A distinction
seems occasionally made ; in a sea-fight Richard cast out of his galley wild fire into the
sky, “and fyr Gregeys into the see‚’' so that the water appeared all burning with the
dreadful compound. In Chron. of Eng. written about t. Edw. II. a strange tale may be
found of the hot bath concocted by King Bladud, with many things eraftily combined in
brass tuns,-brimstone‚ salgemme and saltpetre, sal ammoniae and nitre‚ “ with wylde fur
ymad ther to.'' Ritson, Metr. Rom. vol. 11. p. 277. The popular tales regarding these
inextinguishable compounds are not without interest as connected with the prototypes of
those appliances of war which in our days arrest such universal attention. Caxton, in the
Mirrour of the world, part 11. e. 21, says of divers fountains, that there is one towards the
East “ wherof is made fyre grekyssh with other myxtyons that is put therto‚ the whiche
fyre whan it is taken and light is so boot, that it can not be quenehyd with water, but
with aysel, uryne, or with sonde only. The Sarasyns selle this water right dere and
derrer than they doo good wyne.'' After the time when gunpowder came into general
use the deadly volunta and compositions devised by the Arabs, as detailed in M. Reinaud‘s
curious treatise‚ were not wholly abandoned. Grafton tells us that, at the siege οἰ
