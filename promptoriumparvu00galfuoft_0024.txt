xvi PREFACE.

compiler of the Promptorium. In the Glossary to Hearne's edition of
Langtoft's Chronicle, under the word “Nesshe,⁷' the following statement
appears: “Maken nesshe is interpreted mollz‘fico and molleo (so 'tis ex-
pressed for mollz’o,) in the Promptorium parvulorum sive clericorum (call’d
also Medulla Grammaticae), a very scarce folio book printed by Richard
Pynson in the year 1499, being the 14th year of the reign of King Henry
⁷ VII. at which time it was look’d upon as a work of great use and excel-
lency, as may appear from this printed note at the end. qTAd laudem et
ad honorem,” &a (as given in the account of Pynson's edition, p. xlii. infra.)
“ The author was a preaching or black Fryer, and follow’d the dialect
of the East parts of England, to which he had been used from his infancy,
as he tells us in his Prologue. His name was Richard Frauncis, as Ι find
by this note written in an old hand at the beginning of a copy of this book
that was lent me by ΜΓ. Ward of Longbridge, viz. ἽῙ Nomen Compilato-
ris istius libri est Frater Ricardus Frauuces, inter quatuor parietes pro
Christo 11101115115.”ὗ1 Against this statement, however, which is at most
the anonymous note or tradition of some previous possessor of the book,
may be cited, first, an entry of equal authority in a copy of the same
edition by Pynson in the public library at Cambridge—“Autor hujus
operis fuit Galfredus Grammaticus dictus, frater Ordinis S. Dominici.’'
To this friar we find the authorship ascribed by the learned Bale, Bishop of
Ossory, himself an East-Anglian, not indeed under the title of the Prompto-
rium, but as the Medulla Grammatices, distinctly identified however by
the incipial words of the Preanzbulum as the work more commonly known
by the name first mentioned. Bale, whose Catalogue of the writers of
Great Britain was published at Basle in 1557‚b writes also thus with his
accustomed critical asperity :·-—“ Galfridus Grammaticus, ad scholas semper
a puero nutritus, sub corruptis, obscuris, ac barbaris praeceptoribus,prima
ojus artis rudimenta edoctus, corruptior ipse aliorum tandem magister
evasit. Sibi ipsi nihilominus, non aliter quam olim arrogans ille Palaemon,
adfectus, multa tribuebat, tanquam essent cum eo nato simul et bonae
literae, et bene dicendi artes obortae, atque cum eo demum moriente et illae
simul essent interiturae. Ciceronem, Salustium, Servium, Plinium, Var-
ronem, Vergilium, Horatium, Quintilianum, et alios bonos authores in

ἃ Peter Langtot't's Chroniclc, edit. Hearne, vol. ii. p. 624.

Ι) In tho first edition, printed at Ipswich, 1548, the notice of Galfridus varies only in a
few particulam frmn that above cited.
