sriry, MS. Reg. Paris, which gives ‘⁴ pelluris, heaume [le cuir ou depel.‘⁷ Palet appears
to have been a term adopted from the French: “palet: sorte d’armure de tetes

palet and the kettle-hat. Compare KETYLIAE ΗΑΤ, Pellirz's, {Jalerus¹ p. 973. Minot,
alluding to the battle of Cressy, in a poem written about 1:552, tills the Frenchman,
