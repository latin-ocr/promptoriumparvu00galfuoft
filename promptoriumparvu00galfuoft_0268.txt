¹ To fleet, or skim the eream, is 3 verb still commonly used in East Anglia, and the
utensi] which serves for the purpose 15 termed a fieeting-dish. “ I flete mylke,
take away the ereame that lyeth above it whan it 113111 rested.'’ PALSG. “ Esburrer,
to fieet the ereame potte3 Zaz'ct σεῖηιννέ, fleeted milke; maique, fleeted milke, or
wlmye.” Hollyband’s Treasurie. “Escremess fleeted, 35 milke, unereamed.'' COTG.
Ang.-Sax. flet, flos lactis. A celebrated Suffolk 6116656, made of skimmed milk, is
called flet-eheese. Tusser, in his 1655011 for the dairy maid Cisley, on bad qualities of
6116656, says,

“ Gehazi his 5161111655 was whitish and dry,
Such 61166565, good Cisley, ye floted too nigh.''

² The term fleet, signifying a channel, 311 arm of the sea, or water-course, occurs not
infrequently in several parts of England, 35 Northfleet and Southfleet on the Thames,
the meet-ditch, London, Holt-Fleet on the Severn, near Worcester, Fladbury, anciently
Fleotbury, and 'l'wining meet, on the Avon. On the coasts of Norfolk and Suffolk
the name 15 common, and properly, according to Forby, though not invariably, implies
a charmel filled by the tide, and left at low water very shallow and narrow. At Lynn‚
where the Promptorium was compiled, there are several 6113011615 50 called, as White
Friars' Fleet‚ and l'urfleet. The grant of the possessions of the Gild of the Holy
Trinity‚ Lynn, by Edward VI. A.D. 1548, alludes to rents laid out in “repairing of
11311115, walls, fletes, and water-courses in Lenn.⁹' Blomf. IV. 598. “Flete where
water cometh, breche? PALSG. Augu-sax. fleot, simus. In the North, as Bishop Kennett
notiees in his glossarial collections, 11661 signifies water, as in the ancient song over
a eorpse.
“ This ean night, this ean night,
Every night and awle,
Fire and fleet, and candle light,
And Christ receive thy sawlff’ Lansd. MS. 1033.

³ “ To flete above ye water 3 his cappe fleteth abone the water ν11001161· 3 farre 116066.”
PALSG. ‘⁶ AVzczf-*iyem to saile, 1ο fleete.” Hollyband's Treasurie. Harrison, in his description
of England, speaking of Lyme Regis, Dorset, says, “ the Lime water, which the towns-
men call the Buddle, commeth . . . from the 11115, fleting upon 1061116 soil, and 50 falleth
into the 5611.” 1101111511. Chron. i. 58. Aug-Sam. 11601311, fluctuare. Sec ΙῐονΥΝ, which
