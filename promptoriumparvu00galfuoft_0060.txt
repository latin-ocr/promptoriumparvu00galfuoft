xlviii · PREFACE.

for instance, in the words “ dethe, tetche.'’ Although probably redundant,
or merely an accidental error, the contraction has been printed as in the MS.
The chief difficulty has however arisen from the frequent use of fia and
1”1, the latter especially in the verbs, with a prolongation of the last stroke
of the letter in each instance. It should be observed, that in early typo-
graphy these letters are not uncommonly found with the like peculiarity3
it is believed that, occasionaliy, in writing of the fifteenth century this
elongated minim may denote a mute final e, and, accordingly, it has been
thus indicated -m’‚ n', or‘in’, ss, leaving the decision in questionable cases
to those who may take interest in analysing the unsettled orthography of
the period. thilst9 however, there can be little doubt that these terminal
contractions have the power of mme, or nne, respecffively, the anomalies
which occur have induced me to retain them, and especially on account of
the peculiarity 111 the verbs, which here claims notice.

It is worthy of remark that, though the verbs in the infinitive mood at
the time when this work was compiled were in general no longer written
with the final “n'' of the Anglo-Saxon infiniffive, they are here found
ending in “ yn, yfi, ysi', yng‚ en, 61“1, efi', on, one, in.’' Those in “ yn, en,
on, and in ” may possibly represent the Anglo—Saxon infinitive in “ an;”
but those in “ γῇ, yff, yn', yng‚ esi, efi', ὀ116,” should seem to represent the
AngIo-Saxon gerundial infinitive in “ anne'' or “ enne.” On this subject
the following observations of Professor Bain may not be dcemed out of
place :--

‘⁸ In Anglo-Saxon the infinitive was formed by a. suffix‚ and had cases
like a 1101111. Νο111. and 300. ‘ writ—an‚' to write3 dat. ‘ to writ-ann-e,’ for
writing. This last case had the meaning of purpose, and corresponded to
what is now called the gerund. The simple form ‘ writ·an’ was the
same as our infinitive. XVhen the case-endings‚ ⁴ an‚’ ‘anne‚' were lost,
the sign ‘to ’ remained‚ and, not only so, but was erroneously prefixed to
the other cases of the infinitiva, instead of being confined to the dative 01·
gerund case. By this mistake we have the same form for both applica-
tlons.

Α “ Parthen the form ‘writ-an’ changed in another direction. The termi-
nation ‘an’ became first ‘en’ and then ‘ing‚' thus producing the form
‘ writing' as an infinitive form, which explains our having 311 infinitive
