¹ The verb to dere, or hurt, is commonly used by Chaucer, and most writers, until
the XVIth century.

“ Fyr ne schal hym nevyr dere.'' Coer de Lion, 1638.

Fabyan observes, under the year 1194, “so fast besyed this good Kyng Ryoharde to
vex and dere the infydelys of Sury.'' Palsgrave gives ‘¹ to dere, or burte, or noye, unire,-
I wyll never dere you by my good wyll. To dere, grieve, blecer5 a lytell thynge wyll dere
hym.’' Sir Thomas Browne mentions dere among words peculiar to Norfolk, in which
county it still has the sense of sad or dire. See Jamieson. Ang. Sax. derian, nocere,
derung, loesz'o. NOYYNGE occurs hereafter.

² The term dese, Fr. deis or daim, Lat. dasium, is used to denote the raised platform
which was always found at the upper end of an hall, the table, or, as here in the Promp-
torium, the seat of distinction placed thereon, and finally the hanging drapery, called
also seler, eloth of estate, and iu French ciel, suspended over it. With regard to its
etymology, various conjectures have been offered by Ducange, Menage, and others.
See also Jamieson's Dictionary. Matt. Paris, in his account of the electiori of John de
Hertford, Abbot of St. Alban's‚ A.D. 1235, and the customary usages on the occasion,
say5‚ “solus in refectorio prandebit (electus) supremus, liabens vastelhcm, Priore praa-
dente ad nmquam mensam quam Dais vulyariter appellamus.'' Ducange suggests that
vastellum may here mean a canopy or hanging dais, from Ang. Sax. vatel‚ leymetc, um-
braculum. chancer, in his Prologue‚ describes the haberdasher and his companions,
members of a fraternity, and having the appearance of fair burgesses, such as sit ⁴⁴ at a
yeld hal, on the hie deys.¹' Gower speaks of a king at his coronation feast, “sittend
upon his hie deis.'' In the Boke of Curtasye, Sloane MS. 1986, f. 17, written
about the time of Henry VI. a person coming into the hall of a lord, at the time of first
meat, is advised not to forget

‘⁴ be stuard‚ countroller‚ and tresurere
Sittand at de deshe bou haylse in fere.’'

In the ceremonial of the inthronization of Abp. Nevill, A.D. 1464, after the Lord and
the sti-angers had entered, the marshal and other officers were to go towards the “ hygh

table, and make obeisance‚ first in the midst of the hall, and agayne before the hygh
