either inserted or taken away, so as to widen or contract it 3 thus the attire of the Car-
penter's young wife is described, who wore

“ Α barm-eloth, as white as morwe milk,
Upon her lendes, ful of many a gore.'' Miller's T. 3237.

Here it doubtless signifies that her apron was gathered in with numerous plaits, in
girtling it about her hips. Sir Thopas says, where he relates his dream,

‘⁴ An elf—quene shall my lemman be,
And slepe under my gore.'' Cant. Τ. line 13519.

Herc the expression seems to be one of those conventional phrases of romanoe of which
the meaning cannot be closely defined, and implying ample coverings, garments full and
rich. In Emare, the Queen of Galys is said to be ⁴⁴ goodly unther gore,—wordy unther
wede‚—come]y unther kelle.'’ Ritson, Metr. R. ii. 243. “ Goore of a smocke, poylzte de
chemise.'' PALSG. ‘⁴ meroni, the gores of a woman's smocke, or other lyke garment.''

¹ In the North, and other parts of England‚ the Εἶρα· Europccm, Linn. or common
furze, is called gorse. Aug-sax. gorst, erico, rubus. See the note on the word FYRRYS,
above. “Ruscus, a gorst‚ or a furse.” MED. MS. CANT. In the margin is the addition
in Somner's hand, ot' the Ang.-Sax. words, “ cneoholen, syres-'⁹ Cotgrave gives “genesi
espinezmt, furres. whinnes, gorse. tliorne-broom.''

2 The Potffltz'lla anserina, Linn. or wild tansy‚ is called in the North, according to
Ray, geom-grass, because eaten by geese. The plant, however-,most commonly known
by the name, is the (iulium aparine, or cleavers, which. as Moore observes, is called in
suffolk “guse-grassf' Dr. Turner, in his Herbal, 1561, speaks of “Gooshareth or
clyuer.’' Cotgrave gives “ G'rzcleron, the small bur called goose-share, goose-grasse,
love-man, cleas-er, and elaver. Rseffhle, cleaver. goose-grasse, &c.'' Huloet calls the same
plant ‘¹ goslingweede‚ rueba (sic, 'rubea 2) minor.‘’

³ GOSSXPMANN, MS. The Baptismal sponsors were formerly called gossips, a term
which Skinner derives from Ang.-Sax. God, Deus, and syb, affinitas, as it were ‘⁸ coynatt
2⁴72 Deo ; '⁹ and by the Canon law marriage was forbidden between persons thus allied,
as much as between relatives by blood. In the Lay le Fmine, it is related that the
knight, to whom two sons were born, sent to greet a knight who was his neighbour,

“ And pray him that he com to me,
And say he schal mi gossibbe be.''

It would hence seem that the term comprised not only the co-sponsors, but the parents
of the child baptized. Verstegan, in his explanations of ancient words, observes upon
‘⁶ Godsip, now pronounced gossip. Our Christian ancestors, understanding a spiritual
affinity to grow between the parents and such as undertook for the child at baptism,
called each other by the name of Godsib, which is as much to say, as that they were sib
together, that is, of kin together through God.” p. 175, edit. 1655. Fabyan says of
the rcpudiation of Ingebert of Denmark by Philip Augustus, king of France “yt was

not longie or she were⁹ from hym deuorced for cause of alyaunce of gossyprcd, or other-
wise.” ‘art vii. c. 242.
