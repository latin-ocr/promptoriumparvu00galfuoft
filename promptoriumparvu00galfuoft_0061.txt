PREFACE. xlix

and a gerund in ‘ ing.’ This change seems to have been facilitates] by the
existence of a class of abstract nouns in ‘ing ’ (Anglo-Saxon unq), which
by their nature are nearly allied to the infinitive.

“ To increase the confusion still farther,the imperfect participle originally
ending in ‘ ende,’ ‘ ande,'—-‘ writende,'-became a form in ‘ ing.’ Thus the
same ending in English represents four different verbal endings in Anglo—
saxon: the infinitive, the infinitive of purpose (gerund), the verbal noun,
and the participle.’⁷ ‘²

It will be seen that, although the letter p should seem to have been
fully recognised‚ and it takes in the alphabetical arrangement the penulti-
mate place assigned to it in the Anglo—Saxon alphabet, yet not unfrequently,
through inadvertence or transitional orthography, the scribe has written
‘ th,’ whilst in other words the proper character is represented, as it was
generally in the following century, by a y. Thus we find “ Blo erye, p.
40; Erye, or erthe3 Eryyn, or of the erthe,'⁷ p. 141 z'nfi‘cc, and the like.b

It has been suggested that a list of the principal MSS. and printed
authorities, mediaeval vocabularies, glossarial and granimatical compila—
tions, with many rare works which throw light on the language of the
period, would prove acceptable. The enumeration here appended includes
chiefly MSS. and printed works of reference from which Ι have drawn
materials for the notes. With these will be found, however, some not thus
cited, but which are of essential interest to the student of the English
literature and archaisms of the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries.
