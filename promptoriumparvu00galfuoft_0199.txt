that “cowde is an old English word, signifying a gobbet, morcell, or peece of any
thing cut out‚” but 110 appears to have taken it from the Promptorium, and Skinner
gives it on his authority. Possibly cowmz may have some analogy with eud, which in
the Promptorium is written eood. See above CHEw the cood. Ang. Sax. eud, rumen..

¹ “A coueut, conventus, conventimluss’ CATH. ANG. The derivation of the word is
here evidently from the French, convent, and not from the Latin: and the orthography
of the name Covent Garden thus appears to have the sanction of ancient authority.

2 Among the virtues os “ horliowne‚” as stated in a translation of Maeer's Trcatise 011
Plants, MS. XVth Ceut. belonging to Hugh W. Diamond, Esq. is the following: “ bis
erbe y-dronke in olde wyne helpib be kynges hoste, and be eomone coghe eke.⁷' In
another place a deeoction of roots of “skyrewhite” is recommended to heal “ be
chynke and be olde eoghe.'' Skinner says the hooping-cough was tei-med in 1111100111-
shire kin-cough, and derives the word from the Belg, kicnkhost, and the verb hinc-ben,
difficulter spirare. See hereafter HOOSE, or cowghe, and nos'rrff.

‘² The eope was originally worn with a hood, which at a subsequent time was repre-
sented only by embroidery 011 the back. Hence, probably, this gai-nient was sometimes
tei-nied a cowle. Chaueer repeatedly terms the monastic habit a eope. See the descrip-
tion of Huberd the Frere‚ who was not like a “ eloisterere,''

‘⁴ With thredbare eope as is a poure scolere.
Of double worsted was his seinieope,
That round was as a helle, out of the presse.''

wardens of Walden, in Essex, occurs a charge in 27 Hen. VI. 1448, for a “cowle pro
aqud benedieea, x.‹b.'' Hist. of Audley End, by Lord Braybrooke. In Essex the term
cowl is applied at the present time to any description of tub. See Kennett's Glossary,
under the word cowele; 110 supposes it to bc derived sroin cucula, a vessel shaped like
a boat.
