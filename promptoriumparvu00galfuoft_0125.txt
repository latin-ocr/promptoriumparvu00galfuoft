¹ The banker was a eloth, carpet, or covering of tapestry for a form or bench, from
the French “banquz'er‚ capis pour mettre sur un banc, stra-(sulum abaci.'' NICOT. coTGR·
“ Amplzz'tapa est tapetum circzcmfz'losum, a woll loke.'’ ORT. “ Tapes utrinque villosus-''
Dte. 3 denoting the coverings of arras and tapestry work, wrought, perhaps, on both
sides, such as are enumerated in the Inventory of Sir John Fastolfe's effects, 1459.
Archaeol. xxi. 257, 265. We there also find “Banker, hangyng tapestry worke,''
which may mean the tapestry commonly in use for hangings, or that the Banker was in
this instance the covering of a high-backed seat, over which it was hung. In an earlier
Inventory of the Priory‚ Durham, 1446, occur ‘⁶ iij Bankquerez paleat' de hloclio intenso
ec remisso ‚· costerce pro ornatu murorum ejusdem camerae‚'' these last being of the
same suit as the Bankers, that is, of eloth of say, paly dark blue and light. Inventories
published by the Surtees society, i. 92. In the Teutonic, lauch-werck is rendered by
Kffian, “ tapes, opus polymitum, ναί-90 bancalia, scamnalia, subsellii stmyulumst' A
Vocabulary of nearly the same date as the Promptorium gives “pepotasz'ua bachis,
banquere.” ROY. MS. 17. C. XVII. This word has been in Boucher’s Glossary incor-
rectly explained to mean a table-eloth.

² Baptym is not an error of the scribes, but a singular corruption of orthography.
In the other MSS. as well as the printed editions, the same spelling occurs, In
the Wieliffite version it is thus written, as also baptym, and baptem, in the Legenda
Aurea. The observation would be trivial‚ did it not afford an evidence of the pre-
dominant influence of the French language in England at the period3 the word is
evidently thence received, and not from the Latin.

³ Compare hereafter DEBATE MAKER, or barator, incentor. FEYGHTARE‚ or baratowre,
puynax, which is distinguished from FEYGHTARE, puynator, showing that the word
implies one of a contentious disposition, and not an actual combatant.

⁴ spelman explains the barbacan to be “ ‘munimen ὰ fronte casiri, aliter autemurale
dictum ‚· eliam foramen in urbium castrorumque moeniis ad lrayicienda missilia. Sax.
burgekening. Vox Arabica.” Pennant asserts that the Saxons called the barbican to
the north-west of Cripplegate, burgh-kenning 3 other writers have suggested a different
etymology, A.S. burk-beaten, urbis specula. Bullet would derive it from the Celtic, bar,
before, bach, an inclosure. Lye gives barbacan as a word adopted in the Anglo-Saxon
language, and we must certainly not seek thence its derivation. The best specimens of

the outworks to which this name was given were at York‚ and called the Bars, of which
one still exists in good preservation.
