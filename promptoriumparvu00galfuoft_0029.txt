or Grammatices. The notiees of the reeluse of Lynn, to whom we are un-
doubtedly indebted for the Promptorium, would be incomplete without
some account of the Medulla, and of such MSS. of that valuable compila-
tion as Ι have been enabled to discover. The two works have been ascribed,
with much probability, to the same author. I have, however, failed to
discover any contemporary statement to that effect3 the name of Galfridus,
it is true, is found as that of the author in several MSS. of the Latin—
English dictionary in question, but such entries are, I believe, by a later
hand. This ascription may be solely on the authority of Bale, who giveS, as
before cited, among the writings of Galfridus Grammaticus, the following 2-—

“ Hortum Vocabulorum, lib. i. U t etenim multos (nostrae prce.

“ Medullam Grammatices, lib. i. Cernentz'bus solicite clerz‘607'zmz.⁷'

The Proloyus of the Latin-English dictionary, the Ortus, printed by
Wynkyn de VVorde in 1500, begins “ Ut etenim multos,’' &e Ι have never
found this preface in any M S. ε the only prologue oecurring in MSS. here—
after described of the dictionary entitled Medulla, of which Ι believe the
Ortus to be a modified reproduction, begins “ Hec est regula hujus libri.”
See notices of these M SS„ p. l. to liv. infra.

The second work attributed by Bishop Bale to Galsridus, under the
title of Medulla Grammatices, seems to have been in fact the English-
Latin dictionary or Promptorium, the prologue of which begins alike in
the MSS. and in the printed copies with the phrase given by Baka—‘⁴ Cer-
nentibus solicite clericorum.'’ But in the colophon of Pynson's edition of
1499 sve find-A Finit excellentissimum opus, dcc. quod nuncupatur Me-
dulla Grammatice.'' See p. 539 infi'a. In WVynkyn de VVorde's edition the
corresponding phrase is—“opus quod merito Medulla Grammatice apud
nos, vel Paruulorum Promptuarium nuncupatur.'’ Hence doubtless, has
arisen some discrepaney which it is desirable to point out, since Pits and
the learned Bishop Tanner have followed Bale in ascribing to our author one
dictionary (English—Latin) under a title which properly belongs to another.a

The MSS. of the Medulla are more numerous than those of the Prompto-

⁵ It deserves notice that these authorities agree in ascribing the authorship of the
“ Hortus Vocabulorum ” to Galfridus Grammaticus, and it will be remembered that Bale
first published his account in 1548, abouta century possibly after the recluse at Lynn
brought his labors to completion. There can be little doubt that they contributed
largely to that book, although his original compilation may have been amended and
