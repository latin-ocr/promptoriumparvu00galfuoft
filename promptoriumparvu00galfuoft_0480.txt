¹ Various conjectures have been made on the origin of this term, derived by Skinner
from panis matulina-3, by Tyrwhitt from hlaine, the province where it might have been ι
made, perhaps, in great perfection, and by Sibbald from pain cl’amand, almond bread.
Mr. Pinkerton explains it as signifying the chief bread, the bread of main, or strength.
It is called ‘¹ breid of mane‚’' Dunbar, Maitl. Poenis, p. 71 ; and “ mayne bread ’¹ in
Sir John Neville's accounts of the expenses of 1115 daughter's wedding‚ 1526; Forme
of Ciny, p. 180, where the item also occurs “ 6 doz. hlauchetts, fis.‘’ It would hence
appear that Jamieson‘s conjecture that bread of mane and manchet-bread are synonymous
15 (111651101131116. Κ111311 gives Teut. “Maene, i. wegghe, libum lunatum. XVegghe,
payns triticeus, libum oblonqzmz.'' Compare WYGGE, brede, hereafter. The derivation
is obscure, but the term clearly denotes bread of a superior quality ς thus Chaucer uses
the simile “ white as paindemaine‚” Sire Thopas, Cant. T. v. 13‚655 ; Gower also
speaks of ⁴‘ paindemaine ‘' as a delicacy fit for the rich alone. Conf. Am. vi. In the
Anturs of Arther at the Tarnewathelan‚ it is said that

‘⁴ Thre soppus of demayn
VVos bro3te to Sir Gauan,
For to comford 1115 b1·ayne.‘⁷ St. 37, ed. Robson.

The Harl. MS. ⁶279, f. 10, supplies instructions for the preparation of such consolatory
sops. ‘⁴ Lyode Soppes. Take mylke an boyle it, and banne tak 3olkys of eyroun,
ytryid fro 116 11111116, 311 draw hem borwe a straynoure‚ and caste hem in to be mylke,

soppys‚ an caste 116 50111115 ber on, and 561116 it forth for a potage.” In the Forme of
Cury repeated mention occurs of ‘¹ flour of payndemayn,'' probably the fine white
flour of which it was made3 see pp. Ξῖ, 30. The delicacy called Η615151165” was
composed thereof, p. 73 ; and “ payndemayn ’⁷ itself 15 mentioned, pp. 34, 65. The
Issue Roll of Exch. 27 Η611. VI. 1449, records the payment of ιέῨΙΟ to John Eton‚
baker of “ paynmau ‘' for the King's table, in consideration of good services, and the
great charge incur-red by him in providing bread for the Sovereign. lt appears also
that in 1455. in the Household of Hen. VI. there were, 111 the Office of the Bake-
house, one ‘⁸ Yoman Pay(n)men-baker,'' and a groom. Household Ordin. published
by Ant. Soc. p. ³⁴’‘19. ‘¹ Payne mayne, payn de bouche.'' PALSG. ‘⁶ Payn de boueke,
as Pain mollet. A very light, very crusty and savory white bread, full of eies, leaven,
and salt.’' corn.

'2 A PALET was a kind of head-plece, usually formed of leather or cuir-bonini, whence
the name seems to have been derived. “Pelliris—, (solea ω’ coreo et pelle.'’ CATH.
