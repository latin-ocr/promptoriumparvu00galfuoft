¹ “ Tz'nctor, a linter, or heuster.” meo. Sir Thomas Phillipps' MS. “ Τίησίον, tinc-
trioe, a lyster.” ORTvS. “A iittester. tinctor, tinctrix.” CATH. ANG. Walsiugham
relates that the Connnons made a rising in the Eastern Counties, in 1380, at the
time of Jack Straw’s rebellion, their leader in Norfolk being “quodum {ductore «le
Norwico, cujus nomem erat Jclmmzes Littestere,'' who called himself King of the
Commons, and was beheaded by the Bp. of Norwich: ed. Camd. 26:³1. ln the Paston
Letters, iii. 424, mention occurs of another Norwieh “lyster.” Tho word occurs also
in the Towneley Mysteries. At Lynn, where the Promptorium was compiled, the
continuation of Broad Street, otherwise Websters' Row, is called Lister Gate street. See

J amieson.

² The reader, who occupied the second place in the holy orders of the Chureh, is
probably here intended. In the Vision of P. Ploughman mention is made of “lymi-
tours and listres,'' 2747. Mr. Wright, however, supposes that the word signifies

deceivers.

³ The term “liser '' occurs in the Vision of P. ploughman, 2891, in connection with
the ‘⁶ drapiers‚'' or weavers of eloth. “Lisz'ere, the list of eloth, or of stuffe3 the
edge, or hem of a garments' COTG. Palsgrave gives also “Lyste of clothe. Zisz'ere.
I lyste a garment, or bordex· it rounde aboute with a lyst, ie betcde ‹l'une ἰίείὲνε. Ι

⁴ The process of making “litere” for beds is set forth in the chapter on the duties
of the grooms‚ “yarciomwn.” Sloane MS. 1986. Boke of Curtasye, edit. Haliiwell,
Ρ ⁵ In the other MSS. the words from mma to LYGHTESUMNESSE, given above, pp. 303,
304, are placed here. They are not, however, in? all cases written in conformity with
this position in the alphabetieal arrangement, being mosny in the King’s 0011. MS.
written Liht, Lihtsum, διας in Sir Thos. I’hillipps’ MS. Lyth3, or bryghtnesse, &c.;
and in the &Vinelh MS. Lyth, Ly3th‚ Lyhth, Lyhtsum. These irregularities are to be attri-
buted to the second hand, who, writing by ear, vitiated the spciling of the original MS.
