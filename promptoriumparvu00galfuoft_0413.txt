preferred, as expressive of the burden eonveyed by him. Lodesman generally signifies
the leader of a ship‚——-a pilot, as the term is used by Chaucer, Legend of Hipsiphile, and
by Gower. In the WVax-drobe Book ‘28 Edward I. p. 273, a payment appears “pro vadiis
unius lodmamzi conducti pro meve ,qaiamdcif' apparently bringing ‘supplies to Karlaverok.

See Jamieson, v. Ledisman. [n the statute 31 Edward ΙΙΙ. c. 2, a fishing vessel is named,

¹ An evident distinction is here made between LOKE, meaning apparently the leaf of
a door, or shutter‚ and look of a door, in its ordinary sense. In both cases the term is
taken from Ang.-Sax. loc, claustram, sera. In the Register of W. Curteys, Abbot of
Bury, now in the possession of Edm. Woodhouse, Esq. an Indenture is preserved, dated
1438, for the performance of certain carpenter's work in the chapel of St. John at Hille,
Bury, by John Heywod, of Ditton, Camb. in which the following clause occurs: ‘⁶ And
to eythir dore of the same ehapel he shal do maken a louke of estriche borde competent.”
It seems here to denote what is commonly called the wicket, or hatch of a door; valva
is rendered in the Medulla “ a wyket ; '' and this signification is more clearly defined in
the Ortus: ‘¹ Valva est ostium, vel porta parva in majori existens.'’ In the Promptorium
wicket is given as synonymous with a little window.

² In the Latin-English Vocabulary, Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII. under Nomina vermium, f.
55, b, is given ‘⁵ fllultz'pes, lugdorre.'’ Jamieson states that the Lamia-icus marinus, Linn.
a worm which is dug out of the saud, and used for bait, is called a lug. The name dor
denoted a beetle or chafer, but more properly a drone. Aug-Sax. dora,fucus.

³ “ Apostaticns, i. perversus, a renegate οι· a Lollarde. IIeretlcu-s, errans in fide,
an heretyke, or Lollarde.’' ORTUS. “ Lollar, heretiqae.’‘ The sect of Lollards appears
to have arisen in Germany as early as 1309, according to Hocsemius, and the rise
of Lollardy in this country during the reign of Richard ΙΙ. was probably due to the
influence of his alliance with Anne of Bohemia. Knyghton states that the “ Wycli-
viani, qui et Lollardz' ‹lie-ci sunt‚’' flourished and increased about 1387; and givesa
