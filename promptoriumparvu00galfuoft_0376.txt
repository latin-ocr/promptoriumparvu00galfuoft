nearly the same, and from the wide projecting brim bearing much resemblance to a
caldron. It is, however, certain that armour of leather was silvered over to give it the
appearance of metm, and it is highly probable that cair-bouins, which supplied defences
osa very serviceable nature, and more commodious than plate armour, was extensively
used. The form of the kettle hat, at the period when the Promptorium was compiled,

may be seen in the drawings in Rous' Life of Richard Bcauchamp, Earl of WVarwiek,
Julius, E. Π. Strutt’s Horda‚ vol. ii.

¹ The reading of the MS. is here canus, which seems to be corrupt. “ Chanms, {senns
freni, ε’. capistrum, εί pars freni, moleyneffl MED. ‘⁴ camus, a byt, or snaffle.'' ELYOT.
The Promptorium gives CHAVYLBONE, 112[1.7zd2'l224l(1‚ which may possibly give a clue to the
derivation of the term kevyl, a bit for a horse. It has not been noticed as retained in any
provincial dialect in England, but Jamieson gives “Kewl¹ a halter brought under the
jaws of an unmanageable horse, and passed through his n10uth.”

2 Catz'llare signifies to mew as a cat; but ylatz're properly denotes the noise of dogs3

4 Kedge, brisk‚ budge, hale and lively. Suff. Ray and Moore. Kedgie‚ Caigie3 Jamieson.
Forby gives kiek, signifying in Norfolk a novelty or a dash3 and kieky, showy. Both
words are given in a like sense by Jamieson. ⁴· He's in high kick‚” is a proverb in the
Craven Dialeot. Compare Su. Gr. kaeck, Germ. keck, Isl. kiaekr, audax, animosus.

⁵ Cumula, MS. In a roll of 2-5 Edw. I. among the miscellaneous records of the
Queen's Remembraneer, a payment occurs “ Stephano le Missum, pro j. Kemhelz'm'z subtus
cisternam Reqis, z·1jd.'' The Latin-Engl. Vocabulary, Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII. gives,
under the head ‘¹ ad brasoriam pertinencia, Kymnelle, cuna ,- Kunlione, cunella.’‘

‘¹ He goth, and geteth him a kneding trough,
And after a. tubbe, and a kemelin.'' Miller's Tale, 3622.
