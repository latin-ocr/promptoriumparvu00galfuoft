¹ The kenet is mentioned in the ‘⁶ Maystere of the Game5 c. xiij. of rennynge houndis.
There ben also rennynge houndes, some lasse and some moor3 and 1>0 10550 byn clepid
kenettis‚ and bes houndes reunen wel to al maner game, and 1101501νοηο for al gameg men
clepin hem heirers, and euery hounde bat 1101) bat corage wil falle to be an heirere of
nature with lite! makynge‚'' &c. Vesp.. B. ΧΙΙ. f. 65. From this passage it might be
supposed that harriers were originally so termed as being well adapted for close pursuit,
and not from their being specially used in hunting the hare. Roquefort gives ‘⁴ Ιωνίενῃ·
presser, karceler, pom-suz‘w-w’ In ‘⁸ Dame Julyans Bernes doct1·yne‚” in her Boke of Hun-
tynge, it is said, ‘⁴ Thyse ben the names of houndes. Fyrste there is a Grehounffle), 0
Bastard‚ a Mengrell‚ a Mastif, a Lemor, 0 Spanyol, Raches‚ Kenettys, Teroures, Butchers
houndes, dunghyll dogges, Tryndeltaylles, and pryekeryd currys3 and 51110110 ladyes
popees that bere awaye the flees, and dyuers 5111010 fawtes.'' Sign. 0. ij. νο. ed. 1496.
Roquefort gives “cltiennet, chenez&- en bas Lat. ckenetus,” as signifying a little dog3 and
the term occurs in the satirica} Anglo·Norman poem, descriptive of the lady of the XIVth
cent. and her dogs, who, as it is said, ‘⁶ pias ad cher ult kenet ke nul welze hou torst Rel.

Antiqu. i. 155.

“ La troverez les kenez sayllazmz cum 9rfflloun.
Ε les grauns levares raumpanz cum lyou7t.'' Harl. MS. 209, f. 7. b.

In the ancient romances the kenet is mentioned as used in the chace of the deer, and the
wild-boar. See the descriptions of the hunting parties of King Arthur and his knights,
in the Anturs of Arther‚ st. iv.; Avowynge of King Arther, st. vi. ed. Robson, pp. 2, 60.
They here appear to have been led in coupleS, and used with the bounds called raches,
and berselettes‚ besides ‘greyhounds. It seems, therefore, that they were the smaller dogs,
which served to find the beast of chace, and on that account kenet is here rendered repe-
rarius. Venatz'caw is rendered in the Ortus “a spanyel.” ‘⁶ A kenit, ccmiculus.“' CATH.
ANG. See also Syr Gawayn aud the Grene Kny3t, line 1701, ed. Madden. Palsgrave
gives ‘⁶ kenet 00101110, conda-df

² In the Vision of P. Ploughman the verb to kenne repeatedly occurs in this sense. See
also Syr Gawayn and *the Grene Kny3t‚ line 1434 ; Towneley Myst. pp. 9, 10.

³ Will. VVorcester uses the term kenning to denote a distance at sea, pp. 179, 313;
