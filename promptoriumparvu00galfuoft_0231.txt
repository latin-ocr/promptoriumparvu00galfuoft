¹ A rybbe is an household implement‚ which probably received its name from its
form, a kind of seraper or rasp used in making bread3 thus Palsgrave rendere ‘⁴ dow-
rybbe, ratisseur ὰ paste.'' The term occurs in the gloss on Gautier de Bibelesworth.

'¹ Vostre paste domet pesti-ez, (kned bi douw)
De vn rastuer (a douw ribbe) Ze auqe (a trow) mozmdae,
Le rastel (a rake) e le rasim·
Sount diuersas en lom· ¹1›zesler.’' Arund. MS. 220, f. 299, b.

Hence it appears to have served for seraping and cleansing the kneading trough. An-
other implement‚ termed likewise a rybbe, was used in the preparation of flax. See

hereafter RYBBE, and mnssffi flax.

² In the Forme of Cury, p. 20, will be found recipes for egurdouce, a eompound of
the flesh of rabbits or kids with currants, onions, wine, and spiees; and for egurdouce of
fysshe, pp. 63, 113. Direetions are also given for concoeting “an egge dows,'’ which
seems more to resemble the mixture alluded to in the Promptorium‚ being composed of
almonds, milk, vinegar, and raisins. ,Μαίης signifies a kind of mead, and dowce egyr
was probably much the same as oximel.

³ ‘⁸ Dughty, ubi worthy.'' cun. ANG. A. Saxon, dohtig‚ instructus.

⁴ This word is still used in Norfolk‚ in the sense of to draggle‚ and a slattern is
called a drabble-trail. Ang. Sax. drabbe, foeceS.

⁶ Draffe, or ehaffe, is a word that occurs in Chaueer:

“ Why shuld Ι sowen draf out of my fist,
Whan Ι may sowen whete‚ if that me list.'’ Persone’s Prol.

In the Reve’s Tale the scholar John complains of being left to lie in his bed “like a
draf sak.” So likewise in Piers Ploughman's Vision, where allusion is made to casting
pearls to swine, it is said that

“ Draf were hem levere,
Than al the precious perree.'' line 5617.

In the Vocabulary, Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII. occurs under the head “acl brasorium per-
tinencia, (Iragyiwm, draf;'' and in the Oath. Ang. “(lraf, seyislerinm, steinalum, brusts.
