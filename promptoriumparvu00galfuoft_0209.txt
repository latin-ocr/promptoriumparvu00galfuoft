PALSG. The earliest mention of this mode of punishing female offenders occurs in the
laws of Chester in the time of Edward the Confessor‚ as stated in Domesd. i. f. 262, b.
The fine for using false measures was fixed at 4 shillings; “simililer malum cervisiam
faciens, aut ilc σιιὶῘιειίνᾶ ponebatur stercoris, aut iiij sol. dabat prepositz's.'’ lt was
called in Ang. Sax. “scealfing-stoL sella arimanni-[a im quii rixosae mulieres sedentes
aquis demeoyebantur.” SOMNER. The pillory for male offenders, and cucking-stool for
females, were essentially appendant to the view of frank-pledge, or Leet: inquest was
ordered to be made respecting the sufficient provision of both, by the Stat. assigned to
51 Hen. ΙΙΙ. c. 6; and among the ‘⁴ Capitale» Escaet7·ie,'' one of the duties of thc
Eseheator is deelared to be inquiry “de pilloriis et membellis sine lic-eutici Bessis le-
vatis.'' Stat. of Realm. i. 201, 240. It was termed, perhaps from its resemblance to a
warlike engine so called, {rebat-het, or arebat-laetum. See hereaftcr TREBGET for werre.
By Bracton it is spoken of as tymborella, and in the Statutes tumba-ellus, appellatione
likewise derived from its construction. An instance of the jealonsy with which any nn-
authorized assumption of this manorial right of punishment was repressod, occurs in
the Chron. of Joeelin de Brakelond‚ p. 38, where it is related that about 1190 certain
encroachments were made on the privileges of the Abhot of St Edmund²s Bury, in the
manor of Illegh; “levaverant homines de Illesjcc quoddam trebuchet ced flectendam justi-
ciam pro falsis mensuris panis vel bladi mensurandi, unde conquestus est abbasfl This
punishment was chiefly infiicted in early times on brewers, who are spoken of always as
females‚for any transgression of the assize of ale, “Brocavum (paciatur) mahumetana
vel casti-qentom'wnss' in Scotland it was used in like manner. Stat. of Realnu i. 201,
and Skene's⁴ Reg. Majest. It became subsequently the punishment of soolds, and
women of immoral or disorderly life; thus in the town of Montgomery such offenders
were adjudged to suffer the penalty “de la Goyiay-stoole‚” as appears by a MS. cited
in Blount’s Tenures; in the Leet Book of Coventry mention occurs in 1423, of the
“eokestowle made apon Chelsmore grene to punysche skolders and chidders, as γε law
wyll: '’ and items of account are found so late as 1623, which show that the punish-
ment still continued to be used in that city. Of the ⁴⁴ coke—stool ’' at Norwich, which
was to be provided by the gild of St. George, see Blomf. Hist. ii. 739; an account of
expenses connected with another at Kingston-on-Thames is given in Lysons‘s Env.
i. 233; and in Lord Braybrooke’s Hist. of Audley End, p. 261, are mentioned payinents
so late as the year 1613, at Saffron lValden, where the scene of such punishments at the
end of the High Street is spoken of in 1484 as the “cokstul hend.” 1111555 Max-y
Queen of Seots enacted that itinerant singing women should be put on the cuc-kstoms
of every burgh or town; and the first Homily against contentiori, part 3,published in
1562, sets forth that “in all well ordred eities common brawlers and seolders be pun-
ished with a notable kind of paine, as to be set on the euckiug-stole, pillory, or such
like.'' An original cucking—stooL of ancient and rude construction, was preserved in
the crypt under the chaneel of St. Mary’s, NVurwick, where may still lie scen the three-
wheeled carriage upon which was suspended by a long balanced pole. a chair which could
readily be lowered into tho water, when the cumbrons vehiclc had been rolled intoa
convenient situation. This chair is still in existence at XVarwiek. Another cuc-king-
stool, differently contrived, may be seen at Ipswieh in the Custom llonse; it appears
to have been used by means of a sort of a crane, whereby the victiin was slnng· into
the river, and is represented in the Hist. of Ipswich, pnblished 153», :in-l Geni. Mag,
Jan. 18:51. More detailed information on this eurious subject will lm found in the
