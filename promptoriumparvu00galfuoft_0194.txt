“ Fayre fylyole3 ‘that fy3ed‚ and ferlyly long,
With coruon coprounes eraftyly sle3e.’⁷
Gawayn and the Grene Kn53t‚ line 797.

A round tower appears to have had the appellation of a fyell, a phioll, or fylyole, not
as Ruddiman conjectures. from fiola, a vial, but from phala. “Fula, a tour of tre.’'
MED. GRAMM. In the description of Belshazzar's feast, in another poem of the same
time, cited by Sir F. Madden in his notes on Sir Gawayn, it is said of the covered cups
which were fashioned like embattled eastles,

‘⁴ The coperounes of the cameles, that on the cuppe reres,
ἢέν fetysely formed out in fylyoles longe.”
Cott. MS. Nero, A. x. f. 77.

¹ See hereafter CRASKE‚ or fryke of fatte, a word which seems to be derivable as a
corruption from crassus, or the French cras. Crank, which occurs here in the printed
editions of the Promptorium, usually signifles sickly or feeble, but in Kent and Sussex
it has the sense of merry or brisk; the reading is, however, questionable, as the word
crank does not occur in these editions subsequently, but eraske, as in the MSS.

2 “Aeac coralle.'’ Vocab. Harl. MS. 1557. “ Curailles de maisons, the dust, filth,
sweepings, or cleansing of houses.‘' com. See DRAFFE hereafter.

³ “Corsy‚ corpule7zt2cs.“' CATH. ANG. “Comyfe, corpsu. Comyfe, to full of fatnesse,
corsa, cmpalentst' PALSG. Elyot gives “ Pinguis, he that is fat, corsye, unweldye.”

⁴ Chaueer‚ in the Rime of Sir Thopas, mentions “his shoon of cordewane; ' and
in the Boke for Travellers Caxton speaks of “ hydes of kyen whereof men make lether;
of fellis of gheet, or of the bukke make men good cordewan; of shepes fellis may be
made the basenne.” The kind of leather to which this name was applied was originally
prfipared at Corduba, and thence, according to ,Iunius and Menage‚ received the ap-
pe atlon.

The Medulla gives “Nimirum tekene of overeomynge.’' Harl. MS. 2257. The
Catholieon gives the following explanation, “dicuntur TVc'celerz'a filateria, qnoe yes-
tabant athletam facta de summitatibus armornm, [ματ a victis acceperwstst' See Du-
range.
