¹ This word appears to be taken from the French, (lelc'vre, and is very frequently
used in old writers. “ Ladesta-is, sleyghe, bisy, or deliuur.’¹ MED. GRAMM.

‘⁴ Deliuerly he dressed vp, er the day sprenged.''
Gawa5n and Grene Kny3t‚ 2009.

Palsgrave gives “delyuer of ones lymmes, as they that prove mastrye5‚ souplc‚· de-
lyver, redy, quicke to do anything, ayz'le, delsvrae delyuernesse of body, souplesse.’'
Thomas, in his Italian Grammar, renders “snello, quicke, deliuer.¹' BEYN, or
plyaunte, has already occurred, and bain is still used in Norfolk in the same sense; the
word has also, as shown by Jamieson, the sense of alert, lively, active, or of prepared,
made ready, as has been observed above in the note on BAYNYD, as benys or pesyn.

² The verb to delve, Ang. Sax. delfan, appears to have become obsolete in Norfolk,
and is now rai-ely used in Suffolk‚ but the substantive delf, a deep ditch or drain, is
still retained. The verb occurs frequently in early writers. In the Legenda Aur.
occurs this expression, “I have dolphen in the depe erthe;” and it is related that
when St. Donate conjured his wife, after her death, to rex-eal where she had eoneealed
some treasure, “she answered out of the sepulcre, and sayd‚at the entre of the hous,
where I dalue it.” In the Wieliffite version, 2 Chron. xxxiv. 10, the expression occurs,
“stonys hewid out of be delues (eber quarreris).'' Cott. MS. Claud. E. 11. “Aumjfe-
della, a gold delfe.'' Vocab. Harl. MS. 1002. Delph and delf occur not infrequently
as names of places in the fenny districts of the Eastern counties.

³ “To departe, αόνοφινε, de'sjwzyere, separare. Deparffiabylle, divisibilis. To departe
membres. To departe herytage‚ herecescere. Departyd (or abrogate) abrogatas, dis-
plosas, phariseus, scismaticus. A departynge, Izoerwz's, divisio, scis722a,” διο. CATH.
ANG. In the will of Lady Fstzhugh, A.D. 1427, is the bequest, “I wyl yat myn
howsehold s‘uantz haue departed eni-ag theym a C. marc.'' Wills and Inv. Surtees
Soc. i. 75. So it is said of Christ in the Legenda Aur. “he shall departe the heete of
the syre fro the resplendour and bryghtnesse.'' Palsgrave gives the verb, ‘⁴ to departe,
deuyde tliynges asonder that were myxed or medled together3 departe this slzayne of
threde‚ ‹Ie'smffslcn Departe or distribute the partes of a thynge to dJuers persons, mes-
pa7·tir.” Fr. ([ἐρανίῖν, to separate or distribute, in low Latin, dispertire.
