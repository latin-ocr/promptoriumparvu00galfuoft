¹ The term habergeon appears properly to be a diminutive of hawberk‚ although here
given as synonymous. lVace, in his Roman de Rou, written about 1160, describes the
Conqueror as armai, at the battle of Hastings, with a. “boen kambe-nst but 0d0, his
half-brother, Bishop of Bayeux, who could not decoronsly assume the complete military

equipmfflit, and rode with a staff merely to stimulate the eombatants, provided himself
with this partial defenee.

The precept of Randolph 111„ Earl of Chester, to his barons, about the close of the
XIIIth cent. requires that their knights and free tenants should have “ lowicas, et kau-
hwyellast' and the ordinance of Hen. ΙΙΙ. 1252, “super juratis acl arma,'’ directs that
every mam according to the rate of his land and chattels, should arm himself either
with the lorica, the haam-yeme, called also in this document hauhei-cus, or the per-
pnnclam. The stat. of winchester, 13 Edw. Ι. 1285, makes the same distinction between
the hauhergy', hauberyeon, and parpoz'nt, to be used by the three classes respectively‚
according to their assessment. Stat. of Realm‚ i. 97. From these authorities it is evident
that the habergeon was a defenee of an inferior description to the hawberk; and when
the introduction of plate armour in the reign of Edw. ΙΙΙ. had supplied more convenient
and effeetual defences for the legs and thighs, the long skirt of the hawberk became
superfluous; from that period the habergeon alone seems to have been worn. This,
in its turn, being superseded by the cuirass was reduced to the mere apron of mai1;
but at the time when the Promptorium was compiled, the expensive nature of plate
armour caused its use to be restricted, and combatants of the lower classes were content
to arm themselves with the brigandine, or the habergcon. The value of three “hau-
buriounes.“¹ in 18T4, was 13 marks: see Invent. of Edward de Appelby, Sloane Cart.
xxxi. 2. Milan was celebrated for the manufacture of this defence: in a document dated
33 Hen. VI. relating to armoni· delivered out of the Tower, are mentioned ‘¹ haberg'ons‚
some of Meleyn, and some of VVestmmless’ that is, probably, VVestphalia, or the Wester-
wald, where the iron—works of Solingen have long been in repnte. Arehaeol. xvi. 125.
In the Inventory of SirJohn Fastolfe’s armoury, 1459, are likewise found “ iij. har-
buryones of lunilaynef' Arehoeol. xxi. 271. ln the Wicliffite version Goliath is said to
have had ‘² a brasun basy-net on his heed, and he was clobid wib an haburion hokid (eber
mailid, luo-ivd sqna7nals'1‚” Vulg.) “He shal elohe ri3tfulnesse for an haburioun (pro
ihm-ace, Vulg.) and he shal take eerteyn <loom for a bas)·11et.'' Sapiens, v. 15. “ Bitiae,
