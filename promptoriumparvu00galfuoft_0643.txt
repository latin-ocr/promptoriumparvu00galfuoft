ORTHOGRAPHIG INDEX.

1n this Index are given the principal words which are irregularly spelled,together with their
modern spelling. Those archaic words are cousequently omitted which have no modern ortho-
graphy. It has not been thought necessary to enlarge the index by the insertion of those words
which, although somewhat irregularly spelled. are but little out of their alphubetical place. As has

been stated in the Advertisement, p. vii.‚ the sole object has been to facilitate the reference to such
words as are mis-spelled and considerably out of place.
