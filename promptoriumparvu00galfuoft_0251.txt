in 1507, is the entry, “a fane for my vise (winding stairs); iv vanys for my bruge.''
Rokewode's Hist. of Suff. 151. Chaucer‚ in the Manciple's Prologue, alludes to the rural
sport ofjusting ‘⁶ at the fan‚'' in some MSS. “ van 3 ” which has been explained as sig-
nifying a kind of quintam, so termed from its revolving like the fane of a weather-cock.
In the curious version of Vegecius‚ Roy. MS. 18 A. XII. a passage occurs, however,
which would lead to the supposition that Chaucer's allusion refers to a rural conflict‚
with the winnowing fan, by way of shield ; it declares ‘⁶ how olde werriours were wont
to iuste with tannes, and pley with the pil, or the pale ;'' and that tyros or young soldiers
ought to have “ a shelde made of twigges sumwhat rounde, in maner of a gredryn, the
whiche is clepede a faune—and therwith they sholde haue maces of tree.'' B. 1, c. xi.

¹ To fang or seize‚ Ang.-Sax. fang, captura, fangen, captus, is a verb used by R.
Brunne, and various writers, as late as Shakespeare. See UNDERFONGYN‚ and LATCHYN
hereafter.

² The etymology of this appellation of the sacred vestment, termcd also the maniplo,
is uncertain3 the Latin pannas has been suggested, the German Fahne, or the Ang.
Saxon word of the like signification, fana, vexillam. The resemblance of the maniple
to the penon on the lance, called in France fiwzon, or pharaon, is obvious. The word
can hardly, however, be of Ang. Saxon derivation, as in AElfrie's Glossary‚ written
towards the close of the Xth cent. the maniple is termed “oitcmualis, handlin ; '⁹ and
among the gifts of Bishop Leofric to Excter Oathedral, about 1050, are mentioned
‘¹ iv subdiacones handlin.’' MS. Bodl. Auct. D. 2, 16. Leo IV. Ρ.Ρ. towards the
middle of thc IXth cent. ordained thus, “nullas cantet sine amicta, siue albii, stola,
fanone et casula ;'' and a contemporary writer, Rabanus Maurus, says, “ quartam
sacerdotis indumentum mappula sive mantile est, qaod vulgyo fanonem vocant.” Inst.
Cler. e. 18. The original intention and use of the maniple is explained by Alcuin and
Amalarius‚ writers of the same period, as follows: ‘⁴ Illappzda, que in sinisti-ft parte
9e.etatu7·‚ qud pic-uitam oculorum et narium deterssimusss' Shortly after, however, the
rich and massy ornaments bestowed upon the fanon rendered it unsuitable for its original
purpose. A specimen discovered at Durham, in the tomb attributed to St. Cuthbert,
is still preserved there; it is elaborately ornamented with needle-work, on a ground
woven with gold, and was wrought, as appears by inscriptions upon it, by direction of
AElfleda‚ Queen of Edward the Elder, for Frithelstan‚ consecrated Bp. Winehester
A.D. 905. It was probably brought to Durham, with other precious gists, by Athelstan,
the successor of Edward, in 934. This fanon measures 32} in. exclusively of a fringe
at the ends, 12} in. deep3 and its breadth is 2} in. Elaborate drawings of this inte-
resting relic, and of the stole discovered with it in 1827, are in the possession of the
Society of Antiquaries. They are both ornamented with figures of saints. By this, and
other representations, it appears that the fanon was at that period worn loosely thrown
over thc back of the hand, as on the Bayeux Tapestry in the representation of Abp.
Stigand; but subsequently it was attached closely round the wrist. In a few instances
the fanon appears carried on the right, instead of the left hand, an example of which
occurs in the Bible of Charles the Bald, MS. of the IXth cent. See Montf. Mon.
Franc. 1, pl. xxvi. The fanon was usually of the same suit, (le eadem secta, as the
stole, and the parurcs of the amice and the alb ; the material of which they were formed
was most costly. Among the git'ts of Will. dc Elintune to Rochestcr, it is recorded
