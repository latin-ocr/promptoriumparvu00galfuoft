2 “ Bearwarde, yardeur <Pom-32⁸ PALSG. A curious representation of the bear-ward,

and baiting the bear, occurs in the Louterel Psaker, illuminated in the early part of the
reign of Edw. III. It has been engraved in Vetust. Monum. VI. pl. xxiv. In the
Household Book of the Earl of Northumberland in 1511, under the head of Rewards,
is one of ⁶⁴68. Sd. to the Kyngs or Queenes Barward, if they have one‚'' when they
come to the Earl. Ant. Rep. lv. p. 253. The Earl had also in his own family an official
of the same kind, whose reward was 203. Shakespeare uses the word, and also
bearard or bear-yerd‚ which are synonymous.

³ Beryl is used by Chaucer and the authors of the XIVth and XVth centuries to
denote the precious stone so called, and also 3 finer description of crystal glass, which
resembled it in transparency or colour. This distinction is not preserved here3 but it
is made by Palsgrave: “Beralh fyne glass, beril. Beryll, a precious stone, beril.’'
Elyot renders ‘⁴ Glessum, crystal or berylle.'' See XVhitaker's Cathedral of St. Germains,
ii. 280.

⁴ One of the MSS. of the Medulla renders sporta, a berynge lep; in the Ortus, it
is explained as a bere lepe, or basket. The word is perhaps syuonymous with 13111111*-
LEPE, to kepe yn corne, which occurs above, and in the printed editions is spelled
BARLEP. A. S. bere, hordeum, leap, corbis.

⁵ A. S. 110011113, fermentum. See hereafter SPORGYN, taken from the Freneh, espuryer.

⁶ Alexander Neceham, who died iu 1227, gives in his treatise de metaris rerum, a eurious
account ‘⁴ (Ie ατε que val-rso dicitnr bernekke,'' which greW‚ as he asserts, from wood
steeped in the sea, or trees growing on the shores. Roy. MS. 12 G. XI. f. 31. The
marvellous tales respecting this bird, which has been supposed to be the chenalopeces,
mentioned by Pliny as a native of Britain, are to be found in length in Gesner, Olaus
Magnus, and many ancient writers. Giraldus gives in his Topographia Hiberniae, c. xi. a
detailed account ‘⁴ cle lucernaris ex abiete nascentibus‚‘' as 3 phenomenon of which he had
been an eye-witness on the Irish shores, and states that these birds were, on account of
their half-fishy extraction, eaten during Lent. This indulgence, of which the propriety
was argued by Michael Meyer in his treatise de volucri αφ’ὒονεᾶ, was sanctioned by the
authority of the Sorbonne. It is scarcely needful to observe that the origin of these
strange statements is to be found in the multivalve shell-fish‚ the lepas anatifera, which
attaches itselt= to submerged wood, or the bottom of ships. “ Ciconia‚i. ibis, a ber-
