¹ The pheasant was brought into Europe from the banks of the Phasis, in Colchis,
according to Martial‚ by the Argonauts; it was highly esteenied by the Romans, and
possibly introduced by them into England. In default of positive evidence as to its
existence here iu early times, it ean only be stated that about the time. when the Promp-
forium was compiled, it had become sufficiently abundant in East Anglia. Thus in the
Howard Household Book, aniongst the costs incurred at Ipswich, in 1467, ‘⁶ whane Syr
John How-ard and Mastyr Thomas Brewse were chosen knyghtes of the shyre‚” occurs
the item, “ xij fesawntes, pryse xijs.'’ Household Expenses‚ presented to the Roxburghe
Club by Β. Botfield, Esq. p. 399. ⁴⁴ Ornia: est yellus vel yullz'na silvestris, Angylice a.

³ The love-feasts, or ἀγάπαι of the primitive Christians‚ were held in the churches;
but this usage was suppressed by the Council of Constantinople‚ AD. (391, and discoun-
tenanced by Greg0r5 the Great, in his Letters to the British converts. It is probable
that the author here refers solely to the primitive custom. There is no evidence that
the practice of feastilig 111 churches had been retained in an),v part of England; but it
appears prohable that the agmpe of the earlier times gave rise to the church-ale, of
which, and of 11111105, frequently celebrated near the precinct of the chureh, a full account
will be found in Braud's Popular Antiq. See the Hierolexicon D. Macri, Ducange, and
Spelnmn, r. Agmpe.
