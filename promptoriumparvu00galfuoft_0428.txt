in French, marchas,- aud in Britain the terms “ marches of XVales—the Northern
marches,’' were still in use at 110 very remote period. Aug-Sax. mearce, fines. See
Kilian and WVachter. The verb to march, to border upon, is used by Gower; Sir John
Maundevile also describes one course for the pilgrim to the Holy Laud “ thorghe
Almanye, and thorghe the kyngdom of Hungarye, that marchethe to the lond of Polayne
(quod conterminum est.)'⁷ See Voiage, pp. 8, 50.

1 It has been affirmed that the Mara was revercnced as 3 deity by the Northern
tribes3 in Britain it appears only to have been regarded as 3 supernatural being, the
visits of which were to be averted by physical 611311115, 511611 35 1116 hag-stone, called in
the North the mare—stane. Of the popular belief respecting the Ephialtes see the
curious passages printed by Mr. Wright in the Introduction to the Trial ofAlice Kyteler ;
and Keysler, Ant. Sept. p. 497. Chaucer gives in the Miller's Tale, v. 3481, 3 singular
night spell, to preserve the house from the approach of spirits, and ‘¹ the nightes mare.''
“ Night mare, youblz'n..'’ PALSG. It was termed in French qodemare‚ according to

are mentioned ‘⁶ muscles, that haue within hem margery perles of alle maner of colour
and hewe, of rody, and reed purpure, and of blewe, and specially and moost of white.'’
Chaueer speaks of the precious “ margarite perle‚'’ formed in a blue musele 511611 on

f. 12³, VO, allusion is made to the supposed cause of the formation of ‘¹ margery perle—
produced in muscle, or cokle, from dew of heaven.'’ In the Wicliffite version pearls
are called “ ma1·garitis,'' Matr. vii. 6 ; xiii. 46. Horman observes that “ margaritis be
calledypearles of 3 mountayne in the see of Ynde, called Permula, where is plentye of
them. ’

3 This term is synonymous with that used by Chaucer in reference to the Miller of
Trumpington, described as being proud 35 3 peacock, and whom none dared to touch or
aggrieve ; “ He was a market-beter at the full.'’ Reve's T. 3934. The old Glossarist
explained this as denoting one who made quarrels at the market, but it seems rather to
imply oue who swaggers about, and elbows his way through the crowd. ‘¹ A merket·
