¹ A ggin signifies, according to the old writers, a cunning or deeeitful device. and
thence an ingeniously eonstructed machine of any kind. Chaucer uses the word in both
senses; thus the crafty triok of the Alchemist‚ which is termed “ a false get,” as has been
observed in the note on the word GET, is called also ‘¹ a false gin.’' In the Squire’s T. it
is related that the magical steed of brass would bear its rider at pleasure‚

“ And turne again with writhing of a pin;
He that it wrought, he coude many a gin.''

In the Golden Legeml, the wiles of Satan are termed “ gynnes of temptacyon‚'' Life of

they are continually in Trevisa’s version of Vegecius, Roy. MS. 18 A. XII. ‘⁴ Troclea,
the gyn whyche is called a crane.’' ELYOT. See Hartshorne's Shropshire Glossary,
“ Exostra, a vice or gin of wood, wherewith such things as are done within, out of sight,
are showed to the beholders by the turning about of wheeles.'' Junius·s Nomencla'tor,

Hing at his girino, white as morow milke.”
