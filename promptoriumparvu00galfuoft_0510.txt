Chaucer ‘⁴ polive‚’⁷ according to the reading which has been usually given. Squire's
Tale, v. 10,948. POLEYNE may possibly be taken from the diminutive poulz'on, a little
pulley. ln Pynson's and the other editions the word is printed Poleyn. Palsgrave

‘⁶ Ther was swilke dreping of the folk,
That on the feld was neuere a polk,
That it ne stod of blod so ful,
That the strem ran inti] the hul.” Havelok, v. 2685.

“Serobs, idem qu. fossa, a deche or a polke.'' Harl. MS. 1002, f. 148, νο. Sir
Thomas Browne‚ in his account of fish taken on the coast of Norfolk, speaks of
congers, which, in frosty weather, upon the ebb of the tide. are left in “ pulks and
plashes ’' on the Northern coast. The word is still used in Norfolk and Suffolk, and
signifies a hole full of mud, a shallow place containing water. See Forby and Moor.
Ray includes it amongst North-country words, and Jennings gives it as retained in
Somersetshire.

2 Sir Thomas Browne, in his Vulgar Errors, makes mention of “the Aquatile or
water-frog, whereof in ditches and standing plashes we may behold many millions every
spring in England,’⁷ produced from spawn which becomes ‘⁶ that which the ancients
called Gyrinus, we a Porwigle, or Tadpole.” B. iii. c. 13. Forby gives Purwiggy, a
tadpole‚ and polliwig‚ which he considers to be a corruption of the former word. Moor,
however, states that the tadpole is called a pollywiggle in Suffolk. The fishermen of the
Thames have given the name polevvig to the spotted goby. Yarreu, i. 0253. The tadpole'
was also called in former times a poled, or pole-head. In the Latin-English Vocabu-
ῙᾶΓΥ, ROy- MS· 17 C. XVII. f. 55, v0, occur under ‘¹ Nomina vermium, Lambricus,
Pole hede; Rullus, (ἓ) Polhed.’' Palsgrave gives “Poled, a yonge tode, eauesot.
Polet, the blacke thynge that a tode cometh of, cuuesot,’' and cavesot is rendered by
gotgmve “ a pole-head, or bun-head, the little black vermine whereof toads and frogs
