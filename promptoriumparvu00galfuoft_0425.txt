1 This term denotes most commonly the disease in the legs of horses, as causing
them mul andare, to go ill, according to Skinner's observation. Μαῐαηᾱνία, however,
in medieval Latin, as in French‚ malandrie, denoted generally an ulcer, a disease diffi-
cult of cure, as leprosy. See Ducange. “ Maiandrie‚ sickenesse, malandre. Malandre‚
mala71d1·e‚serot.’' PALSG. In a veterinary treatise, Julius, D. V111. f. 114, the following
remedy is given “ for the Malaundres. Tac parroures of chese, and tac hony, and tempre
hem to-gedre, and ley hit on be sore as hot as βου. may.”

‘2 ‘⁴ A male, mantica, involucrum.'' CATH. ANG. “ Male, or wallet to putte geare or
stuffe in, malle.'’ PALSG. Horman says, “ Undo my male, or boudget (bulya, hip-
popera, bulyula.)‘’ The. horse by which it was carried was termed a somer, or sempter
horse, sommier. See SOMER nous, hereafter. In Norfolk the cushion to carry lug-
gage upon, behind a servant attending his master on a journey, is still called a male-

illion.

p 3 “For-naculum, Forma-ale, instrumentum ad opus fornacis, a malkyne, or amalott.‘'
MED. MS. CANT. “ A malyne (sic), tersorium.” CATH. ANG. ‘⁶ Malkyn for an ouyn,
frovyonst’ PALSG. Holliband renders “ Waudrde, the clout wherewith they clense, or
sweepe the ouen, called a maukin. Escouz'llon, an ouen sweeper, a daflin.” “A
malkin‚ vide Scoven (sie). A Scovel or maulken, liqumclum, scopula. Peniculum, a
bull's tail, a wisp, a shoo-clout‚ a mawkin, or drag to sweep an oven.” GOULDM. This
term is still used in somersetshire. It would appear from the Medulla that this word
was also used as an opprobrious appellation ε “ Gallinae-ius, i. homo debilis, a malkyn,
and a capoun.” Forby gives maukin, as signifying either a dirty wench‚ ora scarecrow
of shreds and patches.

⁴ Compare Βοτνυε, malte-worme3 p. 46, and BUDDE, flye ; p. 54. In the Eastern
counties weevils that breed in malt are termed bowds, according to Ray, Forby and
Moore3 the word is repeatedly used by Tusser. R. Holme says that “ the NVievell eateth
and devoureth corn in the garners: they are of some people called bowds.⁷’ Acad.
ofArm. B. ii. p. 467. The appellation is applied to other coleopterous inseets. Gower
compares the envious to the ⁴⁶ sharnbudes kynde‚'’ which, flying in the hot sun of May,
has no liking for fair flowerS, but loves to alight on the filth of any beast, wherein
alone is its delight. “ Crabro, quedam musca, a gnat, or a sharnebode. Scarabeus. a
sharne budde.’' MED- R. Holme mentions the “ matta, or shorn bud, or painted
beetle.’· Ang.-Sax. scemn, stercus. In Arund. MS. 42, f. 64, an insect is described
which devours the young shoots of trees. ‘⁴ Bruk is a maner of flye, short and brodissh‚
and in a sad. husc, blak hed, in shap mykel toward a golde bowde‚ and mykhede of
twyis and kar-vis atte moste of a gold bowde, a chouere, ober vulgal can y non berfore.''
The name gold bowde probably denotes a species of Clzrysomela, Linn.
