conuenant, it will accord perfectly with the French word. In the Romanoa of Sir
Amadas, “ conande '² occurs in the sense of a covenant:

“ The conande was gud and fynne.'’ Weber, Metr. Rom. line 700.

In Mr. Robson's edition the word is printed “couand,” possibly a contractiori of
‘⁶ couenand‚’' which is found in the context. See stanzas 63, 64, the Anturs of Arther,
st. 16, and Avowynge of King Arther, s. 38, where occurs the same word “ conand,''

¹ Compline, called in Latin Oompletorz'um, completa, or complenda, “quod caetera
dimna* officia complet et claudit‚'' Duc. is the service with which in monastic estab-
lishments the day closed, after which, by the rule of St. Benedict, all converse was
forbidden. It was called in Ang. Sax. niht-sang, vespertina cantio, completorium, and
Abbot AElfric speaks of it in his pastoral Epistle translated from Latin into the lan-
guage of England‚ by order, as he states, of Abp. Wulstan. The seven canonical hours,
that the four synods had appointed for daily services of praise to God, are in this
epistle stated to be matins with the after song appertaining thereto, prime, tierce, sext,
none, vespers, and compline (niht-sang). Ancient Laws and Institutes‚ ii. 377. See
also the Regularis concordia Angl. nationis monachorum. Amalarius says, “comple-
torium ideo dicitur quia in eo completur quotidianus usus cibi vel potus, seu locutio
communis.'' De Eccl. Offic. lib. iv. 0. 8. The hour of compline is stated by FuUer,
in his Church Histmy, B. vi. 278, to have been at 7 o’clock, but in Davies’ Rites of
the Church of Durham, it is fixed at an earlier hour.

’Ζ Cuma, MS. The verb cungyfi is evidently derived from the low Latin constare,
and Freneh εοηρέεν, signifying to send away, to give license 10 depart.

³ In 1110 Commentary on the Equiv‚ Vocab. Interpret. of J oh. de Garlandia abacus is
explained to be the marble table whereon, in the feasts of the aneients, the cups were
placed3 “apud modernos fic de aliis lapidibus, sive de liquis artificiose conjunccis‚et
vocatur a cupl›orde.'' The cupboard was, in the more common sense of the word, an
open buffet, whereon a rich display of plate was made, such as Hall and other chron—
iclers describe frequently. It was also sometimes closed with doors, as usual at the
present time; such asin the will of Elizabeth Drury, in 1475, 15 0311οᾱ 3 “cupbord
with two almeries.'' Rokewode's Hund. of Thingoe, 284. The livery cupboard, often
mentioned in accounts and ordinances of household, was open, and furnished with
