‘⁶ The pilory and the cucking-stol beth i-mad for noht.'’

It seems also to have been called thewe, as in the Plac. in Ilia. (12)ch Cesti-iam. 14
Hen. VII. cited by Blount, it is recorded that George Grey, Earl of Kent, claimed in
his manors of Bushton and Ayton, to punish offenders against the assize of bread and
ale, “per tres rz‘ces per amco-ciamenta, ct quamsi vice pistores per pilloriam, bracia-
tores per teemlmellnnz, et 7*2'.z·czlrz'rc³s pm· thewe, hoc est ponere eas super scabellum
vocatum a cucking stool.’' In cases where fine was substituted for the cucking-stool‚
35 3 punishment. the lord became liable to the forfeiture of his manorial liberties, as in
the ease of the Dean of Lincoln, in 1384, who fined transgressors of the 3551Ζο of bread
and ale, in certain of his mauors in Derbyshire, whereas “pum'emlc' sunt per pillorz'um
et lancha-dhan, et uon per anzcrciamevta ,·” for that offenee, and the deficiency of pil-
lory and tumbrely his liberties were seized, and forfeited into the King’s hands. Pat. 8
Rie. II. The tumbrel seems to 110 occasionally mentioned as distinct from the stool,
and sometimes as the same mode of punishment, and from the examination of the stool
and its carringe still preserved at lVarwick, it 15 obvious that the two might be used
either singly or together, according to local usage, and the nature of the offence. An
extent of the manor of Marham, in Norfolk, taken about the commeneement of the
XVth cent. states that W. Beleth, who held the chief manor, claimed “habere liber-
tatem in fam-ld, tecznzho·elc’, thewe‚ emendacionem jb2·z'.{siccta›·e pistorum, brasz'cztormn,
mensur', galone, weyf, ct stray ;'’ and that the Abbess of Marham enjoyed 1110 like
liberties. Orig. Roll, 111 1110 possession of Sir Thomas Hare, Bart. In the XVIth cent.
tho punishment of the cucking stool was still fully in 115οι by the statute 3 Hen. VIII.
0. 6, 35 1110 penalty of fraudulent practices by carders or spinners of wool, the offender
was to 110 “5011 upon the pillorie or the cukkyngstole, man or woman, as the case shall
require.’' Stat. of Realm, iii. 28. In ΜΓ. Beesley's Hist. of Banbury will be found several
notioes regarding the pillory, ‘⁴ kockestoll‚” and tumbrell, in use 31 11131 place as late as
the reign of Elizabeth. Hui-rison, who wrote his description of England about 1579, says
in the chapter of sundry kinds of punishments, ‘⁸ scolds are ducked vpon cucking 5100105

¹ LABLE, MS. labbe, Η. 5. P. Compare BLABBE, or labbe, wreyare of cownselle3 ΒΕ-

WRAYER of counsel, and DYSCURER of cownselle. This word is used by Chaucer:

‘⁴ Quod tho this sely man, I am no labbe,
Ne, though Ι say it, I n’am not lefe to gabbe.'' Miller's T. 3506.

Compare the Dutch labben. Belg. lapperen, to blab, or gossip. Labb, Dialect of Exmoor.

’Ζ It is not obvious in what sense this word 15 here to be taken: the Ortus follows
the explanation given in the Catholicon‚ ‘⁶ labellum, i.pm·vam labrum, a lytelle Iyppe.''
It appears from citations given by Ducange that labellus, lambellns, or ἰαῦἰείίῑιε, denoted
a pendant ornament of dress, or the heraldic label, in which sense it occurs in the grant
of a erest, 1324, Rym. vii. 763. See the observations of Upton on the difl'erences of
