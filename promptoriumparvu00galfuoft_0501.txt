monk‚ in his Chron. of England‚ speaks with contempt of ⁴⁴ Maister Robert Baldokke,
a fals piledde clerke of the Kinge's courte.'' Harl. MS. 4690, f. 62 νο. and 63 v0. So
likewise Shakspeare uses the epithet‚ l Heu. Vl. 1. 3, “ peel'd priest !'’ ‘⁶ Pylled as
one that wanteth heare‚pellu. Pylled as ones heed is, pelle'. Pylled scalled, tiqneux.”
PALSG. In this sense the following passages in the authorised version of the Scriptures
are to be understood: ‘⁴ (30, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled.⁷’
lsai. xviii. 2, 7. The word in the original signifies deprived of hair, plucked, con-
sidered in Eastern countries the highest indignity. Compare lsai. l. 6. Again‚ in
Ezek. xxix. 18, it is said, “ Every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled.'⁷
(depilatus, Vulg.) The term is likewise applied to velvet or napped stuffs which are
worn threadbaoe, shorn‚ or cut. Han, relating the treachery of Humphrey Banaster‚
in betraying the Duke of Buckingham to Rich. ΙΙΙ. says that the sheriff, having appre-
hended the Duke, “ in greate hdst and euyll spede conueighed him appareled in a pilled
blacke cloke to the cytie of Salsburie, where Kynge Richard then kepte his houshold.'’
3 Rich. III. Again, he describes the rich attire of the royal henxmen, who appeared
in “coates of purple veluet pieled, and paned in riche eloth of siluer.” 14 Hen. VIII.

¹ ΡΥΝΤΝΕΝΤΕ, Μ5. Pyment, x. H. s. P. Piqmentum‚ or pimenium, wine spiced, or
mingled with honey‚ called in French piment, was anciently in high estimation. See
Kyng Alis. v. 4178, and V'eber's note. Chaucer speaks of it in Rom. of R. 6027,
Boeth. ii. Gower says of Love,

‘⁴ That neuer pyment ne vernage
VVas halfe 50 swete for to drynke.'' Conf. Am. B. vi.

Under the head nomina pertinencia promptuario, Harl. MS. 1002, is given ‘⁴ Nectar,
piymentum‚ pyment.⁷’ “ Pyment, piment.” PALSG. Amongst the receipts of cookery
in a MS. of the XIVth cent. in the collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps, No. 1470, there
is one entitled “ Pymte. VVyn, sucre yboilled togedere, gyngebred and hony, pondre of
gynger‚ and of clouwes, i-piht wib bornes gret plentee‚ and schal beon adressed in
coffyns of flour of chasteyns t be colour 3olou wyb saffroun.”

2 From this description of the gnomon of a dial it appears that the term orlage cle-
signated, as in accordance with its derivatim, not only 3 clock, but any indicator of
time. “ Sciocerus est stilus positus in circulo ad metiendum horas velformns.'’ on‘ros.
