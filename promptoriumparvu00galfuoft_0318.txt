(the devils) downe 111 to the grounde of the see.” Hence it also signifies the lowest
part of 3 bussding, the foundation. Robert Brunne speaks of “ be groundwalle bil< '' of
Berwick Castle (Langt. Chron. p. 210.); and in the contraet for building Fotheringhay
Chureh, A.D. 1435, the foundations are ter-med “the ground-werk.“'' Mon. Ang. iii.
Sir John Maundevile gives the Greek inscription which was seen on the roc-k whereon
the cross of the Saviour had been set, thus rendered: “ Quod vides cs! fundamentum
(βάσις) totius fidei hujus mvndi, that is to seye, that thou seest is ground of 3116 the
feythe of this world.'’ p. 92. Palsgrave gives “ grounde‚ the botome of 3 foundation of
any thyng‚f07·cdation.”

¹ “Grounde soppe in lycoure, pain trempe. Groundes‚ Iyse of any lyeour, lz'e.''
PALSG. The term appears to imply 3 5οΡ 01· sippet, by which the dregs, still called

the grounds, may be soaked up.
2 A grup or groop signifies in Norfolk a trench, nal-rower than a ditch, as has been

observed in the note on the word GRYPPE. In the North the term retains the signifi-
cation assigned to it above. See Brockett, Craven Glossary, and Jamieson. Bp.
Kennett likewise notes this use of the word: “groop, or grupe, a ditch 01· trench‚ es-
pecially that which runs across the length of the byer, or eow-house; Bor.” Lansd.
MS. 1033. Skinner suggests the derivation from Aug-'Sax. groepe‚ latrina, scobs,
“fllz'nso‘z-iunz, a grope.” ORTUS‘ “A grupe, ininsorz'umst' CATH. ΑΚΘ. Gouldman,
in his Dictionmy, 1664, gives ‘¹ 3 groope in stables and 11011565, mintlzom‘um‚'' from
‘¹ minthos, dung or ordure.’' ELYOT. Μὶνθος, stercus. Ugueio gives the same expla-
nation which is found in the Cafflolicon, “mimatorz’um‚ locus ad 7721'7zye72dum‚ quod
recipit vrinam.’‘ The reading of the XVinehester MS. agrees with that of the Harl. text,
mamistam-lum, but the word appears to require correction.
