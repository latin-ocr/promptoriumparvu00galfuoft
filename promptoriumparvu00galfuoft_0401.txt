there was a pelican “ lettern ” of brass at the north side of the high altar, where the
Epistle and Gospel were sung3 asecond lower down in the choir, in the form of an
eagle of brass, used at mattins. or other times when the legends wei-c read; and there
was also a ‘⁴ letterne '³ of wood‚ like a pulpit, standing and adjoining to [he organ over
the door of the choir. It seems highly probable, as Mr. Rudge supposes, that the white
mai-blo desk discovered in 1813 near thc site of the abbey church of livesham, formed
part of the lectern that was erccted about 1218 by Thomas de Marh berg, at that time
