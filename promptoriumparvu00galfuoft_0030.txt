xxii PREFACE.

rium; they vary in their contents in a remarkable degree3 it might indeed
seem that each transcriber made such modifications of the text as pleased
him, or that he engrafted upon it the additional words and explanatory
glosses which he found inserted by any previous hand. The text also
varies greatly from that of the Ortus printed by KVynkyn de Worde, a
work of considerable rarity, in the compilation of which materials were
undoubtedly derived largely from the Medulla, but with certain additions
from other sources, such as the Breviloquus, the Cornucopia, probably
the dictionary by Nicolas Perotti so entitled, and the Gemma Vocabulorum.
It is difficult to account for the great variations to be noticed in MSS. of
the Medulla and in the early Latin-English Dictionaries which Ι believe
to be substantially the same as that work. None of those known to me
can be assigned to an earlier date than the latter half of the fifteenth cen-
tury. As an illustration of this remarkable wantos conformity, I may
offer the renderings of “ Cim‘flo,’⁷ a remarkable word which will be found
111 the Promptorium as the rendering of ‘⁴ Askysye '³ or askefise3 p. 15,
infra} The principal variations which I have found are as follows :—

“ Cz'mflo, a syre blower‚ a yrene beter’' (sic). , (Harl. MS. 1‚000.) “A
feyre blowere.⁷' (Harl. MS. 2181.) “A aske bathe, s. qui sedet in cine-
ribus, 91 calefactor ferri.'⁷ (Harl. MS. 2:270.) “A fire blower, and a
heter of blode iren, or a axe wadelle.'' (Harl. MS⁴ 2257.) ‘⁶ An askfist
or iren heter.⁷' (Add. MS. 24,640.) “Askebawe‚ qui s. sedet in cineribus,
et calefactor ferri.⁷' (Canterbury MS.) “An aske fyse or irne eter.'’
(MS. Coll. Phillipps‚ 8244.) ‘⁶ A fyyre blowere, an yryn hetere, an
askefycel' (MS. ibid. No. 8306.) ‘⁴ Qui fiat in cinere, vel qui preparat
pulverem muliebrem, angl' aske fyste a fyre blawer or a yrne hotter.”
enlarged by some other hand from the works above enumerated, before its issue from the
press of XVynkyn de WVorde, in 1500.

² The reading in Harl. MS. 221 is Askysye or Askesye, but possibly the word may
be more correctly Askefise3 it was a term of reproach among the Northern nations‚
denoting an unwarlike fellow who stayed at home in the chimney-eorner like a cat
among the ashes. See Ihre, Lexic. Suio-Goth. v. Aska, and the Saga of Rolf, how the
Askefis won the King's daughter to wife. A corresponding Freneh word is given by
Hollyband, ‘⁵ Cendricr, he that keepeth the ehimney-corner, a sluggard‚'' rendered
likewise by Cotgrave “a sluggard‚ slowbacke, idlesbie,'llouse dove, one that sits lurking

in the chinmcy corner.⁴‘' The word may be preserved, as I am infomaed, in the name of a

house in Lincolnshire, Askcfye Hall, near Spalding, once the abode of Maurice Johnson,
but now usually written “ Ayscough Fee Hall.''
