5. J ohannes de Garlondia in diceionario scolastico.--The writings of this

author are of considerable interest to the antiquary, however debased may
be the Latinity of his treatises‚ once among the best elementary auxiliaries
for the instruction of youth. It is not without reason that Erasmus thus
bursts forth in contempt of the complicated sophistries of the Schools.
“ Deum immortalem! quale seculum erat hoc quum magno apparatu
disticha Joannis Garlandini adolescentibus operosis ac prolixis commen-
tariis enarrabantur.’' The curious information, however, preserved in
the De‘ctz‘onarius of John de Garlandia, sometimes called de Gallandia or
Gerlandus‚ may induce us to overlook the imperfect erudition of the
period. The work has been edited with care by M. Geraud in the “ Gol-
lection de Documents inedits sur l'histoire de France‚”¹³ and subsequently
by Mr. Thomas Wright in a valuable volume of Vocabularies edited by
him, and published at the expense of Mr. Joseph Mayer.‘³ It commences
thus,—“Dictionarius dicitur libellus iste a dictionibus magis necessariis
quas tenetur quilibet scolaris,’' 850. The statements of writers on
mediaeval authors and literature are contradictory in regard to the
period when John de Garlandia lived, and the country of which he was a
native. M. Ge'raud came to the conclusion that he was born in France
in the eleventh century3 that he travelled across the seas, returned to
his native country, and there died ; he supposes that the Dictionarius was
compiled towards the year 1200. In this opinion my learned friend Andre
Pottier, in his notices of the MSS. in the Public Library at Rouen which
are under his care, was disposed to concur. There is a MS. of the Diction-
ary in that collection, accompanied by other treatises by John de Garlandia,
including his Liber Dz'stz'gyz'z' mentioned hereafter. Tanner, however, and

“ Campus Florum‚'' by Thomas (wallensis, of which see a notice infra, p. lxxiii.

attributed, as above stated, to John de Garlandia.
