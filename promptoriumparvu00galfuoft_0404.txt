² Culmus is given only in the Harl. and Winch. MSS. The word is not noticed by
Dueange, and possibly is erroneously written for omullus, which, according to Papias, is
calio: fictilis. ‘⁶ Fidelia, olla vel ciplczcs, or a cherne.'' MED. Ang.-Sax. lio, poculum.

Harl. MS. 1002, f. 131, “lentae-o, to wex lethy.{' ‘⁶ Lethi'’ occurs in the vision of
P. Ploughm. 5979, and is explained by Mr. XVright as signifying hateful, but its precise
meaning is not obvious. In a Treatise on Obstetrics, of the later part of XVth cent.
Add. MS. 12,195, particular instructions are given ‘⁵ at what age a maydyn may vse of
drwrery‚” and it sets forth the evils arising from the anticipation of the age of puberty,
“ for trewly and sche vs bat deduyt or bat tyme, on of bes iij. thynges, or elles alle schalle

thin in person. Ang.-Sax. Ιίδ, tener. Compare LYTHE, hereafter.

4 Leik, Havelok, 21'93, and liche, vision of P. Ploughm. signify a living body, asin
line 5599, where Datne Studie is described as “lene of lere, and of liche both :'’ it is so
used likewise in K. Alis. 3432. This is perfectly in accordance with the signification of
the Ang.-Sax. etymon lice, corpus, a body, either living or dead. The latter seems,
however, to have been the more usual sense of the word. Chaucer, in the Knight's
Tale, 2960, speaks of the “hehe-wake ’¹ at the burning of the corpse of Arcite. In
the North the custom of watching the corpse, termed lyke-wake‚ is not entirely laid
aside: see Brockett‚ v. Lake-wake, and Jamieson, v. Lyk-waik. It is by corruption
termed late-wake; Pennant, Tour in Seotl. i. 112. The term is evidently derived from
Aug-stix. lic, cadaver, and waeoee, rc'gsflia. A full account of the usages and abuses
customary on these occasions will be found in Brand’s popular Antiqu. and Ducange,
v. Viyz‘lioe. In the Invent. taken 1421, church of St. John baptist, Glastonbury‚ printed
by KVc-ruer, are mentioned “ iij. lyche bells;‘’ in the Invent. of St. Dunstan’s Can-
terbury, 1500, termed ‘⁶ bclls for niortuarys.‘’ G. Mag. vol. viii. Ns. In the ordinance
