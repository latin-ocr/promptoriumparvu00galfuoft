¹ The word frank appears to be derived from the old French. Cotgrave gives
“Franc, a franke or stie to feed and fatten hogs in ; '³ and Florio renders Sayinam'o,
“a franke, or coupe, or penne; aplace where beasts or birds are fatned.¹’ Ital. Diet.
Harrison, in his description of England, speaking of the mode of making brawn‚ says,
‘¹ it is made commonlie of the fore part of a tame bore, set vp for the purpose by the
space of a whole yere or two, especiallie in gentlemen's houses (for the husband men
and farmers neuer franke them‘ for their owne vse aboue three οι· foure moneths), in
which time he is dieted with otes and peason,'' διο. Β. iii. e. i. Holinsh. Chron. i. 222.
This verb is used by Shakespeare, and repeatedly by Holland, in his translation of Pliny.

of be ehepe, bat is the mawe, and sethe hem wyl‚ and serue forth.'' See also the Forme
of Cury, p. 95. The following metrical recipe “for fraunche mele ” occurs in the

“ Crafte of Cure,” Sloane MS. 1986, f. 85.

‘⁶ T ake swongene eyrene in bassyne elene,
And kreme of mylke bat is so schene,
And myyd bred hou put laer to,

And powder of peper hou more do.
Coloure hyt with safrone in hest,

And kremelyd sewet of schepe on last;
And fylle by bagge bat is so gode,

And sew hyt fast, sir, for bo rode.
VVhenne hyt is sobun bon schalt hyt leche,
And broyle hyt on gredel as I the teche.'⁰
