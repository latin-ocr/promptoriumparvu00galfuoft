called 0111015, in Latin phialae, urceoli, amulvlcr, in Freneh buo-ettae, channam, ἃο.
The Constitutions of lValter de Cantilnpe in 1240 require that in every church there
should be “ duce phiala, ura vinaria, αἰτόνααρῑιανίω, ·” and at the Synod of Exeter in
1257 it was ordained that there should be t‘ns Jt'kzaloeff' wilkins, Concil. i. 666, ii.
13 (3. Among the costly bequests of the Black Ρ111100 in 1376 to our Lady' 5 altar at
Cantcrburv, are mentioned ‘dem cunct: tazllc: come deva: α meles, pm serz “rz ὰ meme
l‘aatim 2>- ”sende meat. ‘¹' Horman, under the head of things sacred, says, Haxe
pure wyne and water in the cruettes, (ιιὶὶῑιῖιε.”

¹ In Norfolk, according to Forby, crish 01· crush signifies cartilage, or soft bones,
and in Suffolk crussel or skrussel has a similar meaning. Ang. Sax. gristl—ban.

2 This term is derived from the old Freneh word creusequin, which signifies a drink-
ing cup. In a MS. Inventory, dated 1378, 1 Ric. ΙΙ. in the possession of Sir Thomas
phillipps, are enumerated ‘⁴ Cn petie crnskyn one Ie 29oe et le coum-cle d’aoyent enon-re
et emn'. Um cruslsgsn de tsi-re §arnis d'a'syent, (1-0. ΠΛ] pot d’aoyent blanc au yzcyse

Vocab. Harl. MS. 1002, occur “ cornua, horne cuppe, picarias, 0111511)’11.”

³ The smallest Anglo-Saxon eoin was the styca, of which two were equal to a far-
thing. Ruding observes that the stycas appear identical with the “misaam'' Domesd.
i. f. 2¹38, and the passage rendered in the Saxon Gospels, “ twegen stycas,” is in the
Wicliffite version, ‘¹ tweie mvnutis, that is a fartliing.” Mmk, xii. 42. See MYNUTE
he1·eafter.1n Duncombe' 5 Hist. of Reculver is given a mortmayn grant, dated 13
Henry VL 143 5, in which half a farthing 15 named as a port 1011 of rent pai :d to the
Hos epita} of Herbaldowne, namely,“ xxx schelynges, and the haifin dell of an 1101ᾶ)113
of 101110, and rente 3eldynge of a quat of berr’ ‚ and an henne and a half, a certell (sar-
cella.) and be iij parte of a certell‚” &e. Bib1.T0p. i. 1:31. At the time however that
1110 Promptorium was compiled it (1005 1101 appear that there was actually a coin of
this value; the mite, as well as its equivalent, called here a cu, were merely terms
retained in ealculaffion, and the latter was commonly used at Oxford ata much later
period. It· is thus explained by Minsheu, who eompleted his first edition in that
University. “A 0110, i. halfe a farthing, so called because they set down in the
Battling or Butterie bookes in oxford and Cambridge the letter q. for halfe a fax-thing,
and in Oxford when they make that cue or q. a sarthing‚ they say, Cap my q. and make
it a fai-thing, thus qa. But in Cambridge they use this letter, a little s. for a sarthing,
and when they dcmand a farthing bread or beare, they say a seize of bread or beare.
Latin, calcus, a cue of 111’011(1.”” The abbreviation q. did not, it plainly appears, always
stand as at present for quadrans, a farthing, but denoted a value of only half that amouut3
and it seems possible that cue or q. may have been an abbreviation of ‘¹ calcus, quarta
pars obolis* ORTL’S. The term cue occurs in Beaumont and Fletcher. See Nares’s
Glossary.
