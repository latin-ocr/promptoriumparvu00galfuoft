I have found no clue to the author; the dialectical peculiarities seem to
indicate that it was compiled in the North-Eastern parts of Enghmd3
amongst names of places occurring in it, besides London‚ Salisbury‚ Rath,
Oxford and Cambridge, I notice Norwich, Lincoln, York, Riclunond,
Rip0n‚ Durham, and Carlisle 3 no other places in the N Orth-Western coun—
ties‚ however, are found. The chief authors and Latin works cited are
Virgil, Ysidore, Papias, Brito, Hugutio, the Catholicon, the Docti-inale,
the gloss 011 the Liber Equivocorum (by John de Gai-landia); many hexa-
meter verses also are given from some popular grammatical work, possibly
by that miter. A fenny district may have been familiar to the author, since
amongst other words we find sedge and sedge hill, rush and rush hill,
namely, as I imagine, the stack or pile of sedge or rushes ; also reed and
reed bed, fen, marsh, “ natte ” and ‘⁶ natte '' maker, “ schergrysse,
cccreoe,'' “ J'onkett for fish, messa,⁷’ &c On the reverse of the last leaf is
the following indication of a former owner :——“ Liber Thome Flowre Succ’
ecclesie Cathedralis beate Marie Lincoln. Anno domini M.ccccc.xx.''³

This venerable relic of mediaeval learning is in very perfect condition.
Its value as a memorial of the state of our language at the period can
scarcely be too highly estimated, and it is probable the MS. may be the
author’s holograph.b At the end is found a Latin and English list of ternis
of consanguinity commencing “ Hic pater, a fader,’' 810.

(4.) I am indebted to Sir Frederic Madden for pointing out to me
another copy of the English-Latin Dictionary last described, written as he

a I do not find the sub-chanter Thomas Flower in the Fasti of Lincoln. John Flower
occurs amongst the prebendaries of that church 111 1571. The owner of the MS. above
described may have been of Lincoln College, Oxford ; Thomas Flower was one of the
proctors of the university iu 1519. Le Neve, edit. Hardy, vol. iii. p. 486.

¹³ Some curious indications occur of popular notioris, which may give a clue to the
country where the author lived. We find the belief in the Iynis fatuus, which is still
rife in some fenny districts, here shewn by the word “ Hobb Trusse, hic prepes, Izc'c oze-
9ocius.” In some parts of England the Will 0’ the wisp is known as ‘⁶ Hob and his

Lanternss³ or “Hob-thrush;” Aug. Sax. thyrs. Brockett gives ‘⁴ Hob tln·ust‚'’ North
country dialect. Again‚ we find “ Sterne slyme, assul1‚” the jelly (cremella) projected
