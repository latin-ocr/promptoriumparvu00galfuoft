note is found, with the exception of Claudius Hollyband’s French and Eng-
lish Dictionary published 111 1593, 410, a volume of some 1-111·11)],ῑι prc-
ccded in 1573 by his “ Frcnch Schoolelnaister,’‘ to which a brief vocabu—
lary was annexed, until the publication of Cotgrave's ‘⁴ Dictionnaire of the
French and English Tongues,’' first printed by Adam Islip, London, 1611.
It was dedicated to the author’s ‘⁴ very good Lord and Maister, Sir William
Cecil‚ knight, Lord Burghley‚⁷' eldest son of the Earle of Exeter,b and
commended “ au fa-vorable Lecteur F rancois ” by J. L'oiseau (10 Tourval,
Parisien.'⁷ The work must have proved highly acccptable, and may still
be consulted with advantage by the students of obsolete language. In
1632 it received the desirable addition of an English-French Dictionary

by Robert Sherwood.c

(31.) “ A Collection of English Words not generally used ;'’ by John
Ray, F.R.S.—The first edition of this well-known and valuable glossary
was published in 16743 the second, much augmented, in 1691 3 and it was
republished in the fourth edition of the author-'s ‘⁴ Collection of English
P1·overbs‚’' 1768.

Α The elementary works by this teacher of languages were in much esteem. Lowndes
does not mention the rare “ Campo di Fior, or else the Flourie Field of foure languages‚
of M. Claudius Desainliens, alias Holiband;” Lond. Thos. Vautrouillier, 1583, 121110.
It contains dialogues in Italian, Latin, Freneh, and English. In regard to early aids to
the study of Italian Ι may cite the Italian-English Dictionary by william Thomas, 1548,
as containing obsolete English words.

ι’ Sir william was grandson of the Lord High Treasurer, created Baron Burgh-
ley by Elizabeth in 1571. He appears by the preface to have been well skilled in Freneh,
and may have received instruction from the author.

⁴³ I may here mention the useful ‘¹ Alvearie, or Triple Dictionarie in Englishe, Latin,
and F1·ench,” 11)] John Baret, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Cooper's Athenae
Cantabr. vol. i. p. 421. It was printed 11)] Dcnham in 1573, and again in 1580, with
the addition of Greek to the three languages before mentioned. Several early and rare
polyglot vocabularies might be enumerated as containing archaisms not undeserving of the
attention of the student of our lang-uage in the Tudor age. 1 recall a curicus ‘⁴ Nomen-
clator'' in six tongues, including Latin, French, Italian, and English, Nuremberg, 15482
Joh. Daubmann ; of which a copy was shewn to 1110 11)] Mr. David Laing in thc Signet
Library at Edinburgh ; the Italian is designatcd as ‘⁶ Welsclzst'
