¹ The Medulla renders “ szffillcctim, fro scel to seel.’' Harl. MS. 2257.
⁹ Palsgrave renders byee by azur: the word is, however, probably taken from the
Freneh couleur bisc, which properly means a brownish or blackish hue. In some

curious instructions respecting the production of fine azure from lapis luzuli, it is
observed that, to distinguish this last “from lapis almaine of whiche men mahen a
blewe-bis azure‚'’ they should be exposed to fire, in which the inferior material turns
rather black, and becomes ¹⁴ brokel.'' Sloan. MS. 73, f. 215, b. Probably byce, οι· rather
blue byce, as it was in ancient times usually termed, was a preparation of zaffre, of a dim
and brownish east of colour‚ in comparison with the brilliancy of the true azure.

³ A.S. biddan, orare. In the Book of Curtasye, the young child, on coming to
church, is thus admonished,

“ Rede, or synge, or byd prayeris
To Crist for all thy Cristen ferys.” Sloane MS. 1986, f. 22 b.

⁴ ‘¹ Boetia, an oxe dryver.” ORT. Compare BEY or boy, scurrus.

³ ‘⁴ To byge, fundare, condere, eclzflcure. A bygynge‚ σοπείντισσῐο, structura. Bygynge
vndyr erffie, subterraneus.” CATH. ANGL. A.S. byggan‚ cedzflcarc. See Big, in Boucher’s
Glossary, and Jamiesou.

⁵ What was the precise kind of cup called byker‚ or beaker, it is not easy to deter-
mine. This word occurs as early as 1348, in the accounts of the Treasurer of Edward,
Prince of wales.- “z'i magne pecie amenti, vocale Bikers, emellccte in fundo, cum coo-
perculi-s· cum huonis, et ex und· parte deauratis.’' In this instance they were destined to
be presented to laelios, (Bestz, Memor. of the Garter, p. 385.) Becher in German
signifies a cup or goblet, as does beker in Dutch and Teutonic; possibly we derived
the vessel to which the name was originally given from Flanders or Germany. Of
cognate derivation is the Italian bicchiero. In the later Latinity bacar, bac-chariam
have the same meaning3 see Ducange. The common root of these words was perhaps
the Greek βικος, vus habens ansas. MENAGE.

⁷ ‘¹ Beekeryng. scrimysshe‚ maske. Bicker‚ fyghtyng, esem-mouchest' PALSG. “Anon
after the fylde began to beker.’‘ HoRM. Skinner suggests the Welsh biom, conflictus, as
the etymon of this word, which, however, he inclines to think 'of Anglo-Saxon origin.
