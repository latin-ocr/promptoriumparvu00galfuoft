¹ This comparative frequently signifies large dimension, and not number. Thus in
Kyng Alis. v. 6529, the rhinoceros is described as ‘⁴ more than an olifaunt ;‘’ and in
the Wicliffite version it is used to express superior, by priority of birth ; where it is
said that Isaac knew not Jacob, “for be heery hondis expressiden be licnesse of be
more son.” Gen. xxvii. 23. In the Version of Vegecius, Roy. MS. XVIII. A. 1⁶2, the
heavy-armed troops are said to have had two kinds of darts, ‘⁴ one of the more assise,
the other of the lasse ; '' the “ pile,” which measured δὲ feet in length, and the ‘¹ broche,’'
which was shorter by two feet. So likewise in the Golden Legend the ‘⁴ more letanye‚’'
on St. Mark's day, is distinguished from the “less letanye, iij. days to fore the As-
cension.’' It is occasionally retained in names of places, as More Critchill, Dorset,
probably so called by way of distinction from Long Critchill, and other neighbouring
hamlets. The rebus, or canting device of the Mortons of Bushbury, Herefordshire,

tun, or its proportion to the scutcheon when-eon it is placed.

’Ξ Morellus is explained by Ducange as meaning subfusca&- so likewise Roquefort
gives ‘⁴ moreh· noir, ίαηηέ, lirant sur Ze brun.’' According to Cotgrave cheval morel
is a black horse. In the Towneley Mysteries, p. 9, ‘⁶ Morelle '' occurs as the name of

one of the horses yoked to Cain’s plough.
3 Gower describes the glowing blush which restored beauty to the features of Lucrece,

on meeting her husband, ‘⁴ so that it myght not be mored.” Conf. Am. vu. In the
curious metrical version of the most ancient grants to St. Edmund’s Bury, preserved
in the Register of Abbot Curteys, the following lines occur in the Charter of Canute :

“ Bexample of whom (St. Edmund) I Knut am gretly mevyd,
To the holy martyr I wyl that al men se,
That his chirche be fraunchised and relevyd,
Moryd and encresyd as fer as lyth in me.’'

Horman, amongst the passages from Terence, giyes the following: “He dredith lest
thz (ἓξὲἰὲἕὲἏῖῐὲῗξέἓῖξξξῒξ-ιξίᾆυοΓάιοῐῗςοὲῗιῗτεὲἑι[ΞΒ. In La3amon “ mor3eue ⁷' occurs
in this sense, ed. Madden, iii. 249, and ‘⁴ moer3eue '’ ii. 175, which is in Wace's original
‘⁸ douaire.’' See Hickes, Thes. i. p. ix. Pref. and Wachter, v. Morgengabe.

⁵ Chaucer, in the Prologue to Cant. T. v. 388, describes the Cook as afflicted with
“a mormal,’' or gangrene on his shin‚ called in Latin malum mortuum, and in old
French mauxmorz. Remedies for the mortmal may be found in Arund. MS. 42,
f. 105, v⁰; and in Sloane MS. 100, f. 58, v0, a compound is described of litharge of
gold, oil of roses, white wine, old urine, διε. which formed “a plastre bat William
