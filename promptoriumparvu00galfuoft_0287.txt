¹ This word occurs in the Harl. MS. alone, and possibly the correct reading may
be GALAWNTE. “ Gallaunt‚ a man fresshe in appareyle.’' PALSG. Aug-sax. gal,
lihldin‹›,s·us. For les-§ivus should probably be read lascivus, i. e. ‘⁶ petulans, luxurians, vel
superbe se (tyens, ioly or wanton.'' omns.

² By Chauoer the nightingale is said to “cry and gale,'' court of Love, 1357; in
which sense the word may be derived froin the Ang.-Sax. galan, canere. Jamie>0n
gives to gale, or gail, to cry with a harsh note. a term applied to the cuckoo; and to
galyie, to roar or brawl. According to Forby, to yawl signifies, in Norfolk, to scream
harshly, as the cry of a peacocl{; and Moore gives yalen, to cry as a fretful child.
“Jappem to bark or baye like a dog, to ywwle, to bawle. Ηοίὶαίὶεν, to yawl, wawl, to
cry out aloud. Moizcmer, to mawle, yawle, or cry like a little child.” COTG. Ang.-Sax.

veiller· hom baille, galpeb.'' See also the Vis. of P. Ploughm. 8‚214; Cant. Tales, 10‚(›·64‚

⁴ Among the spices used in ancient cookery, the powder of galingale is frequently
named, as may be seen in the Forme of Cui-y. It was the chief ingredient in galen-
tine. which, as Pegge suppose8‚ derived thence its name. It was also employed in inedi-
cine, as a cardiac and cephalic. In the version of Macer's Treatise on Spiees‚ MS. in the
possession of Hugh W. Diamond, Esq. it is stated that “ Galyngale resolueb be fleurne of
be stonial{; hit helpib be deiestione; it dol> amende be sauour and odour of be mouthe if
it he eten.” He further attributes to it virtues of a carminative and aphrodisiac nature.
It occurs among spices mentioned in the Household Roll of the Countcss of Leicester,
A.D. 1265; “pro vj lib. Gctlinyalz'zwn‚ ix. s.⁷' (Manners and Expenses of England‚ p. 14.)
chancer makes allusion to its culinary use, Cant. Tales, 383. The annual provision of
spices soi= the household of the Earl of Northumberland, A.D. 1512, eomprised “ Ga-
lyngga, j quarteron.’' According to Parkinson, the real galingale was the root of a
Chinese plant, of which he gives a representation3 but it appears that the root of the rush

called English galingale, Cyperzcs lonqus, Linn. was much used in place of it, both as a
drug and a condinnent.
⁵ Gamo is explained by Ducange to signify “yulosus‚ popinatur, tahernio;” in
