253. See further Sir Samuel Meyrick’s valuable observatione on military garments
worn in England, Archaeol. xix. 228. Ata later time the doublet seems again to have
become a vestment of ordinary use, the military garment which resembled it being
termed a coat of fence. “ I wyll were a cote of defence for my surete, loricli lintlaedJ'
nomn. Caxton says ‘⁴ Donaas the doblet maker hath performed my doublet and my
jaquet, vwnpourpainte‚ et mon paltocque.” Book for Travellers.

¹ DORCERE, Ms.; but this reading is evidently erroneous, and the word is derived
from the French clossier, or Latin dosserium. See DossE, and Donemze, which
occurs afterwards in its proper place. In a Latin-English Vocabularly, Harl. MS. 1002,
f. 144, occur “auknm, sommarium, a dosure;'' and another makes the following
distinction: “cmabatum, hedosour, dorsorium, syd-dosour.'' Roy. MS. *17 O. XVII.
The term occurs in the Awntyrs of Arthure, 431, where a costly pavilion is described 3

“ Pighte was it prowdely, withe purpure and paulle,
And dossours, and qweschyns, and bankowres fulle bryghte.''

Sir F. Madden explains it as signifying here a cushion for the back, but in its usual
sense it seems to denote the hangings or ‘⁴ hallyngs,” of tapestry, which, before the
use of wainscot‚ were generally used to cover and adorn the lower part of the wall of a
chamber. Chaucer uses the word “dosser” in a different sense, speaking of sallow
twigs, which meu turn to various uses,

“ Or maken of these paniers,

Or else hutches aud dossers.” H. of Fame, iii. 850.

Panniers are still called, in many parts, dosses, dprsels, or dorsers. See Ray and
Moore. Hollyband renders“ leone, abasket‚ a doss'er.' ⁷

² Dodded is used in the North in this sense; see Brockett, and Craven Dialect.
Jamieson gives doddy and dottit with a similar signification. In Norfolk doddy still
means low in stature. Phillips has‘ ‘,dodded lopped as a tree3 '' and iu Suffolk scathed
or withered trees are called dooted, in the North doddered‚ words which appear to be
derivable from the same source. Skinner suggests‘ ‘.Belg dodde, caulis ,fasti-3, paxillus. ”

³ This word does not occur in the other MSS.; the reading' 1s probably corrupt, and,
from the place in which it occurs, DOGON' may be suggested as a correction. This
term of contempt seems to be derived from the French ‘Do stam, bredal,lacrymam-P
ROQUEF. See Dugon in Jamieson's Dictionary.
