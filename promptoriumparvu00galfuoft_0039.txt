PREFACE. xxxi

cum comento ’' by that author, a short tract with an elaborate gloss.a
A second copy is also found in the same library, following the tract enti—
tled Distiqius or Dz’stiqz'um,b attributed to the same writer, as hereafter
noticed. That little relic of barbarous Latinity‚ which seems suited rather
to darken knowledge than to initiate the unlearned‚ may probably have
been composed by John de Garlandia, although his name does not appear,
and 1 have not succeeded in discovering the tract in question in any cata-
logue of his productions. It commences thus,—“ Merarii nuper cintillanti
jubare pannidensi rejecta diployde macellam ex bisso subuculam cum
recino duntaxat influo oloserico.” The gloss or commentary gives the fol-
lowing explanation of the title of the work. “Merarii,etc. Hec meraria et
hec merenda est comestio qui manducatur in meridie,’' &oc On compar-
ing some of the Latin words that occur in the Promptorium with a refe—
rence to Meran'us or to the Glossa Merariz', as the authority, Ι find them
all in this treatise, which therefore is doubtless that thus cited. It should
seem that splerarz'us signifies the noon-tide time of the day, when it
was usual to partake of a “ nunchion'' or noon-meal. (See Nunmete, infra,
p. 360.) Whether the title of the treatise, however, was intended to refer in
any manner either to the light of mid-day, or to the timely nourishment
then dispensed, I cannot venture to affirm. As a specimen of its almost
enigmatical contente, the following paragraph may be citedz-—“ Arpaco
hinc repente mihi pseudofania phalam effetavit in campitro machinatam, in
projecto monobatem, in yperliminario diapennemfl

9. Distigius.—In one of the volumes in the Library of Caius College,
Cambridge, entrusted to me as before mentioned by the Master and Fellows
to aid my researches, Ι find, among grammatical writings by John de
Garlandia and other writers, a treatise consisting of 42 hexameter lines
thus entiffled, ‘⁴ Opus istud dicitur Distigium, a dia, duo, et stigos, versus,
quia in duobus versibus comprehendet autor totam sentenciam proverbia—
lem.'’ There are a voluminous gloss in Lat-in and a few interlinear expla-
nations. It commences thus, “ Cespitat (anglice, stumlyt) in phaleris ippus

tract above noticed is not mentioned, however, in the description of this eurious volume.

θ So also in the Ortus Vocabulorum Ι find these words: “ Merarius, τ’, meridianus.
