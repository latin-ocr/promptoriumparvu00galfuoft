(21.) The Book for Travellers.—The earliest printed Treatise for in-
struction in French is Caxton’s “ Boke for Travessers‚” thus cited in my
notes infra, and so entitled 111 Dibdin's Bibl. Spenc. vol. iv. p. 319. See
also his Typ. Ant. vol. i. pp. 315, 317. This rare production of Caxton's
press is a folio, without date, printed at XVestminster, as Ames supposed,
before 1484. The author has not been ascertained. It is printed in two
columns 111 form of a vocabulary Freneh aud English3 being a compen-
dium of household matters, 3111111315, birds, fishes, fruits, viands, merchan-
dise, &a From the cop)⁷ at Althorp, the only perfect one known to Dib-
din, previously 111 possession of Mr. Lister Parker, I was permitted to
extract many eurious illustrations of words in the Promptorium. Mr.
Blades mentions in 1115 Life of Caxton, vol. ii. p. 133, a fine copy in t-he
Cathedral 11111131)Ὗ at Ripon 3 another at Bamborough Castle3 an imper-
fect copy (Spencer duplicate) in possession of the Duke of Devonshire;
and a fragment, txvo leaves, formerly in Aines's possession, now in the
Douce collection in the Bodleian.

mas, Duke of Norfolke‚’' namely, Thomas Howard, High Treasurer to
Ηο111)7 VII.; appointed Earl Marshal 2 Hen. VIII„ chief commander at
Flodden. Sir Hem-y Ellis has pointed out with much probability that
Barclay ³ may have compilcd his ‘⁶ Introductory ⁷³ fron] materials of earlier

news3 the traveller relates the siege of Harfleur, the memorable battle of Agineourt, the
deaths of the Duke of York and the Earl of Suffolk. The King, he says, is on his way
home, the prisoners had reached Dover, the Londoners had gone forth to Blaekheath
well armed that these foreigners might see what stout men the King had left at home
for the safeguard of the realm. Doubtless the arrival of Katherine of France made the
study of French fashionable5 the name of william Kyngesmylle, an Oxford pedagogue
who kept an “ ostelle” in that University, 15 mentioned ; he 1113)* have been the author
of this portion of the MS.
