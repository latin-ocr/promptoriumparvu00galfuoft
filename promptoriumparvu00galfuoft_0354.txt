¹ This word is evidently synonymous with hover. The reading “ sky-is ’⁵ is question-
able, but SKYE occurs hereafter in the sense of a cloud. See the earlier Wieliffite vex·-

because he endeavours to hook, 01· draw in strangers3 but it seems to be allied to the
Ang.-Sax. eacan, ctu-(sere, because he sells at a highci· price than tho first dealer. In
Friar Michael's Satire on the people of Kildare, written about 1308, the huckster appears
to have been a female victualler‚

“ Hail be 3e, hokestcrs‚ dun bi be lake,
Wsp caudles and golokes and be pottes blak,
Tripis and kine fete and schepen heuedes.” Harl. MS. 913, f. 8, b.

In the oath of the beadle of the ward, and of constables, according to the Customs of

of toure,'' may venture forth3 but the captain, who must lead his troops in “small
and light vessels, as galeies, barges, fluynnes, and ballyngers‚’' is dissuaded from the
attempt, Β. iv. 9. 39. &Valsingham relates that in the engagement between the Duke
of Bedford and the Freneh, 1416, “ cepit tres caricas, ec unam lzulkam, et quatuor balin-
