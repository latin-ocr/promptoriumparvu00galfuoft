and it appears from Leland that 20 miles was accounted as a kenning, probably, as the
extreme distance within ordinary sight. ‘⁶ Scylley is a kennyng. that. is to say, about a
xx. miles from the very Westeste pointe of Cornewaulle.” ltin. iii. f. 6. See also f. 13.
In the North, according to Brockett, half a bushel is called a kenning.

Registers at Norwich, Harl. MS. 10, f. 195, b. Camden, in his R-emains, under Sur-
names, explains car as signifying ‘⁴ a low waterie place, where alders do grow, or a poole.''
Car signifies in Norfolk, according to Forby, a wood or grove on a moist soil, generally of
alders. Broekett gives carr, flat marshy land, or a small lake. So likewise Leland‚ in
his description of the N. Riding, say-S, ‘⁶ there is a praty car or pole in Bishop’s Dale.''

² The kerehief, derived from the French couvre chief, or eret-eche, a covering for the
head, the heafod-ela& of the Anglo-Saxons‚ was, until the XVIth cent„ almost an indis-
pensable portion of female attire. Illuminated MSS. and monumental effigies present an
endless variety of the fashions of its arrangement. R. Brunne, describing the flight of
the Empress Maud from Oxford across the frozen Thames, 1142, says that she wore only
her smoek, hut her features were decently veiled. (Langt. Chron. p. 122):

“ ἶΥίβοιιῐθη kirtelle or kemse, saue kouerchief alle bare vis.”

See Coer de Lion, 11:231. Chaucer‚ in the Man of Law's Tale, calls it a “kereher,''
and alludes to the usage that the widow should conceal her face with the “ coverchefe‚”
as so frequently seen on sepulchral effigies. wife of Bathe's Prol. 6171. The kerchief
