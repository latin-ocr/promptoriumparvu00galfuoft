¹ Iu the Inventory of Effects of Sir John Fastolfe, at Caist0r‚ 1459, there appear
the following items in his own chamber: “j. fedderbedde, j donge of fyne blewe,
i bolster, ij blankettys of fustians,j purpeynt,” διο. Archaeol. xxi. 268. A previous
enti-y mentions a “ (longe of purle sylke.”

² The little Grebe is still known by the names didapper, dipper, or dobchiek‚ the
lisa-qums fluviatilis of the older naturalists, Podz'ceps minor of Temminck. Ang. Sax.
dop fugel, merssus, dufedoppa, pelicanus, according to the sense in which the word
occurs Ps. ci. 7, in the Lambeth Psalter3 but its derivation from dufian, immemere,
would make the appellation inappropriate to that bird.

³ Forby and Moore mention the word dop, as used in East Anglia at the present day
to denote a short quick curtsy. Ang. sax. doppetan, mersare.

⁴ ‘¹ Aulemn, dormo-ium, cortina, αηαόατνῑωη, anmtrum, dosure or eurtayne3 colute-
rale, syd-dosour.” Roy. MS. 17 O. XVII. “A dorsure, dorsorian' CATH. ANG.
“Amabam-um, a cortyne. Auleum, an hangyn, τ’. indumentum aule, cortina, or a cor-
tyne.'' ORTUS. M. Paris speaks of the “dost-ale, sive tapesium in quo passio S. Albani
fiyu7·alur,” given to St. Alban’s by Abbot Richard, who died 1119. Among the cloths
of arras and tapestry work belonging to Sir John Fastolfe, at Caistor, enumerated in
the curious inventories taken about the year 1459, occur several “hallyngs’' of ta-
pestry and worsted‚ a term probably synonymous with dorsure. Archaeol. xxi. 259.
See above, nocane.

⁵ Dorlott is taken from the French dorelot, which signifies an ornament of female attire
generally, but here seems to denote particularly the elegant network, frequently enriched
with jewels, in which the hair was inclosed, termed a kelle, caul, or crepine; or the head
dress called a volipere‚ which is mentioned by chancer. ‘⁶ Trica, plicatura vel nexus
capillorzwn.’' οπως. “ Caliendrum, a voliper.'' MED. GRAMM. In 1394 Johanna Laburn
of York bequeaths “j kyngll,j dorlot‚j armari . . . best volet yat se hat, and a red hude
singill.'' Testam. Ebor. i. 196. Cotgrave gives “ dorlon, a Jewel or pretty trinket, as
a chain, brooche, aglet, button, billement, διο. wherwith a woman sets out her ap-
parel; and by the Statutes of the trades of Paris in 1403 it appears that the craft of
doreloterie consisted in making fringes and ribbons both of silk and thread. See Ro-

quefort and Charpentier.
⁶ A dormant or sleeper is a main beam that, resting upon the side walls, serves to

support the joists, or the rafters oi' the roof. It is called iu Norfolk a dormer. ‘⁶ Treine,
a dorman or great beame.’' co'rGB..
⁷ Doss is at the present time the name given in Norfolk and Suffolk to a hassock,
