¹ “ A quarelle, querela, ele. nbi a plante-’¹ CATH. ΑΚΘ. In the Golden Legend a
relation is given of a certain knight. who made annual pilgrimage to the shrine of St.
Μαι-γ Magdalen, and having been slain accidentally, “as his frendes wepte for hym
lycnge on the byere they sayd with swete and deuoute querelles, which suffred hei·
deuoute seruant to deye without confessyon and penaunce.'’

‘2 Robert of Gloucester says that Robert Curthose was so named on account of his

stature, “vor he was somdel schort.’'

“ bycke man he was ynou, bote he nas n03t wel long:
Quarry lie was, and wel ymade vorto be strong.’⁷ P. 41‘2.

Horman speaks of “ a quarry and well pyght man, homo stulard corporis quadrata.”
“ Quarry, fatte bodyed, or great, corpulent.'' PALSG. “ A quarry or fat man, obesus.”
GOULDM. In the Dialect of East Anglia quaddy has the like signification, according to
Porby. In Rich. Coenr de Lion the epithet is applied to a lance—“a long sehafft
stout and quarrey.” v. 493. In the Seuyn Sages a large hall is described as “ quaire.”

3 Horman, in his chapter de re edzfi'catoric‘l, observes that “a quauery or a maris,
and unstable foundacion must be holpe with great pylys of alder rammed downe‚ and
with a frame of tymbre called a crossaundre (fistucti).'⁷ In Caxton’s Mirrour of the
World, part ii. c. ⁶22, it is said, ‘¹ understande ye—how the erthe quaueth and shaketh,
that somme peple calle an erthe quaue, by cause they fele ther the [neue and quave vnder
‘cheir feet.” “Quane myre, fowzdrz‘ere‚ erouliere.” PALso. Forby gives Quavery-

maveqv, undecided, hesitating how to decide.

4 To quell, as used by the old writers, signifies to destroy life in any manner, although
here apparently taken in the sense of stifling. Minot‚ speaking of the Comyn‚ says
that ‘⁶ in haly kirk thai did him qwell.'’ Chaucer, describing a farm yard attacked by
a fox, says, “ the ‹lokes crieden as men wold hem quelle.” Cant. T. V. 15,396. Aug.-
