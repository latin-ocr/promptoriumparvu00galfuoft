hangings with which the side-walls of a hall were garnished, previously to the more
general use of wainscot, appear to have been termed costers. The name was applied
likewise to hangings, either in a church at the sides of the choir, or in a hall near the
high table, as a kind of screen‚ or even to the curtains of a bed. In the Register of the
ornaments of the Royal Chapel at lVindsor, taken 1385, 8 Ric. II. under the head of
“Panniss' several are enumerated. ‘⁴ Duo eosters panni mayni de Velvetto, pro prin-
cipalibus diebus, rubei et viridis coloris, cum magmis imaginihus stantibus in taberna-
culo.” Mon. Aug. T. iii. part 2, p. 81. Ralph Neville‚ Earl of Westmerland, bequeathed
in 1424 to his wife a third part of his estate, “ cum uno lecto (le Arras operato cum
amo, cum costeris eidem pertinentibus et concorcla7ztibus;'’ and to his son Riehard
another bed of Arras, “cum costeris paled de colore rubeo viridi et albo, qui solebant
pendere in massari camerti infra castrum cle ΕΙιεγζῙἸιοίοη.Η Madox, Formul. p. 432.

¹ Chaucer, in the Persones Tales, makes great complaint of the “sinnei'ul costlewe
array of clothing,” occasioned by the extravagant fashions of the time of Richard ΙΙ.
In the Stat. 3 Henry VII. c. 2, against murderers, it is stated that “he that will sue
eny appell must sue in propre persone, which sute ys long and costlowe (emmona, F-r.)
that yt makyth the partie appellant wery to sue.'’ The cath. Aug. gives “costy,
sumptuosusj' and Palsgrave, ‘⁶ costyouse, swnptneuz.’'

² Chaucer uses the verb to costeie in the sense of the French costoz'er, to pass along-
side; as in the complaint.of the Black Knight‚ line 36.

“ And by a riuer forth I gan costeie.”

Palsgrave gives the verb “to coste a countrey or place, ryde, go, or sayle about it,
costier or costoyer. To hym that coulde coste the countray, there is a nerer way by
syxe myle.”

³ Chauoer, in the Legend of Hypermestre, relates that her father Danao gave her
“a costrell” filled with a narcotic, in order to poison her husband Lino. “A cos-
trelle, oneferum, et cetera ubi a flakett. A flakett, flacta, obba, uter, et cetera ulai a
potte.’' CATH. ANG. A MS. of the XIVth century, which gives the explanation of
words that occur in the Missal, contains the following interpretation: “ Uter, Auylice
a botel, secl collateralis, Anylice, a costrelle. De cute dicis utres, de ligmo collaterales.''
M. Paris givesa eurious relation of poison discovered in the year 1258, concealed in
certain vessels, “qnoe costrelli vocantur.” Costerellum or coslaretum, in old French
cosla-et, signifled a certain measure of wine, or other liquids; and a costrell seems to
have been properly a small wooden barrel, so called because it might be carried at the
side, such as is carried by a labourer as his provision for the day, still tel-med a costril
in the Graven dialect.

⁴ Baltlaezcs. which properly implies the girdle or mark of knightly dignity‚ the cinyulum
militare, is here used as signifying a kind of military garment. Compare hereafter
DOBBELET, garment, baltheus. The cath. Ang. gives “a cotearinour‚ insiynium.''
The usage of wearing an upper gat-ment, or surcote, charged with armorial bear-
ings, as a personal distinction in eonffiet, when the features were concealed by the
aventaille, commenced possibly in the reign of John, but was not generally adopted
before the time of Henry 111. A portion of the armorial surcote of William de For-
