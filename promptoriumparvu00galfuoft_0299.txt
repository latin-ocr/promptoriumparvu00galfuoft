¹ A GYTONE, or guidon, is the name of a sort of banner, or streamer, called in Latin
(suido, which Ducange derives from fluida, a guide. Gnidon has been supposed to be a
corruption of yui‹le-lcomme ; and is written “ guydhome ’¹ in Harl. MS. 2258, where it
is stated that its length was to be 2ss or 3yards: “euery standard and guydhome to
have in the chief the crosse of St. Geor-ge, to be slitte at the ende, and to conteyne the
creste or supporter, with the posey, worde and device ot' the owner.” From Harl. MS.
838, it appears that every baronet or superior estate should display a banner, if he were
chief captain; every knight a pennen, and ‘⁸ euery squier or gentleman his getoun or
standard.'’ It is also directed that both the last should be slit at the extremity, whence

probably the getoun was called conscisorimn, as given above. In the contemporary poem
descriptive of the siege of Rouen, A.D. 1415, it is said,

‘⁶ There was many a getoun gay,
With mychille and great array.'’ line 1214.

See Sir Fred. Madden's note on this line, Archaeol. xxii. 3963 and Ret1·osp. Rev. i. 511,
NS. It appears that agytone was not only carried in the field, but attached to the
mast of a ship; thus, in a bill of expenses for the Earl of WVarwick, A.D. 1437, is a
charge, “ Item, a gyton for the shippe, of viij yardis longe, poudrid full of raggid staves,
for the lymniyng and workmanship ij s.'' Dugd. VVarw. In the Will of John, Baron de
Graystok, A.D. 1436, is this bequest: “ leyo pro mortum-2¹0 meo optimvm equum cum εοίᾶ
armatura mea, cotearmour, penon, et gyton', &c.” Wills and Inv. i. 85, Surtees Soc.
Pais-grave gives ‘¹ Guyderne, a baner in a felde, quiden: Gyderne, yzcizlmz: '’ and
Cotgrave has ‘⁴ ¹quiden, a standard. ensigne, or banner, under which a troop of men of
arms do serve; also he that bears it.”

² This word seems to have implied not only to furbish arms, or armour, but, by means
of some kind of varnish. to preserve the polish from rust. Sir John Paston gives the
following direction : ‘⁶ As for my byll that is gylt, Ι wolde it were taken head t0,· there
is von in the town can glaser weel Ι nowe, and ellys late it be weel oylyd.'' Palsgrave
gives the verb ‘⁶ Iglase a knyfc to make it bright3 iesourbis.’'
