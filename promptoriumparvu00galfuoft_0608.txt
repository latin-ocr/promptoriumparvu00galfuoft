¹ See the note on nove, or ground ivy, supra, p. 250. Skinner derives tun hove from
A. S. tun, sepes, and hof, messala, a hoof, from the form of the leaves3 the name is, how-
ever, more probably as suggested by Parkinson, enumerating the various provincial appel-
lations of the plant‚—“ Gill creep by the ground, Catsfoote, Haymaides, and Alehoof most

generally, ol] T9u3nnehoofe‚ because the countrey people use it much in their ale.'' Theater

³ The mineral Turbith, a yellow sulphate of mercury, may be here intended. The word
is found in the winchester and Add. MSS. only. The term Turpetkum, however, is ex-
plained by Rulandus in his Lexicon Alclzemz'oe, as derived from Arabio, and used to de-
signate some bark or root of a plant, which may have been the spice with which the
compiler of the Promptorium was familiar.

⁴ See FLAGGE, supra, pp. 163, 164, and SWARDE, p. 482. “ Turfe of the fenne, Touo-be
cle terre. Turfe flagge sworde, Tourbe.'' PALSG. ‘⁸ A Turse, cespes. yleba. A Turfe graste,
turbariam? CATH. Axe. The distinction above intended seems to be retained in East
Anglian dialect, according to Forby, who gives the following explanation ;—“Turf‚ 3.
peat3 fuel dug from boggy ground. The dictionaries interpret the word as meaning only
the surface of the ground pared off. These we call flags, and they are cut from dry heaths as
well as from bogs. The substance of the soil below these is turf. Every separate portion is a
turf, and the plural is turves, which is used by Chaucer.” In Somerset likewise, peat cut
into fuel is called turf, and turveS, according to Jennings' Glossary. In a collection of
English and Latin sentences, late XV. cent. Arundel MS. 249, f. 18, compiled at Oxford
for the use of sehools, it is said,—“ I wondre nat a litle how they that dwelle by the see
5yde lyvethe when.ther comythe eny excellent colde‚ and namely in suche costys wher
ther be no woodys; but, as I here, they make as great a fire of torves as we do of woodo-'⁵
