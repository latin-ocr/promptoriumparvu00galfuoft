Lutsenborgh, or Luxemburgh, a fact sufficiently evident from the word LVCEMBOR„
LVSENBOR„ or LVSEBVRGENSIS, forming part of the legend which occurs on many of these
pieces. H. Knyghton thus records their importation in 1347: “ Eodem armo defertur in,
Angylz'am per alieniye'szas et ‘incliqenas mercatores salsa moneta quse lussheburue appellata
est; unde apud Londonias multi mercatores et alai plnres tracti sunl et suspensi, et quidam
maglno precio vitam redemerzmt.'' Chron. Cott. MSS. Claud. E. 111. f. ‘2533 Tib. O. vn.
f. 152, v0. In the margin is written ‘⁶ moneta loysburues.’' It appears by the Rolls of
Parliament, vol. ii. 160, that early in that year (20 Edw. ΙΙΙ.) a petition had been pre-
sented by the Commons, which set forth that merchants and others exported the good
sterling coin, and “de jour en autre reportent diverses fiucxes monoies appellez Lusshe-
bourues, dont [α liz-re poet estre αιὴαίέ par dela pur oyt souldz, οιι pur meyns,'' with which
the country was filled. The King's pleasure was that such offenders should be judged
according to law, as “faux moneoursff' In the year following the Commons again
petitioned “pur ce qe la fazcxe monoz'e cle Lusshebourues encres-t de jour en autre‚'’ an evil
attributed to the infrequency and short duration of the sittings of the judges of assize,
praying for “plus aspre renzeclz'e.'' Rolls of Parl. ii. 167. In 1351 these false sterlings
are again mentioned in the petition that declaration should be made by the King as to
what offences should be adjudged treason, of which one was the importation of false coin,
“ sz'come ῖα monoz'e appelle Lusseburghe,'’ or other resembling the coin of the realm, as
fully declared in the Stat. 25 Edw. III. c. 2, where the word is written ‘⁶ Lucynburgh.''
Compare Rolls of Parl. ii. 2:39, and Stat. of Realm, i. 320. These fallacious monies are

ῗὲῐέξᾱ in the Vision of P. Ploughman, which was composed, as it is conjectured, about

‘⁴ As in lussheburwes is a luther alay,
And yet loketh he lik a sterlyng,
The merk of that monee is good,
Ac the metal is feble.” v. 10,322.

In the Cant. Tales, which, according to Tyra-hin, were written subsequently to 1382,
allusion occurs to “ Lusheburghes‚” as coins of base alloy; Monks Tale, V. 13,968: as
likewise in Piers of Fulham, p. 128, ed. Hartshorne,

“ No lussheborues‚ but money of fyne assay.’'

It must be observed, that in Twysden's edition of Knygffion, as likewise in the printed
text of the Rolls of Parliament, the term has been given as Lussheburne, apparently in
consequence of its origin having been forgotten; it seems, however, evident that the true
reading should be Lussheburue, which is merely a variation from Lussheburwe, or Lucyn-
burgh. See further on this subject Ruding, i. 222; Snelling's Plates of counterfeit
Sterlings, and the Blatter fiir Miinzkunde‚ 1839. The import of the word Papio-213 in
relation to base coin is obscure. It is found in the Winchester MS. only. The coins of
the B)·zantine emperors, called perpuri, and the Italian papan-ini, were monies of con-
siderable value, but there was a base coinage in France during the XIVth cent. of pieees
of bad alloy, called parpz'lloles. See Charpentier.
