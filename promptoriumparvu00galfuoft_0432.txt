¹ In Norfolk, according to Forby, the smaller thrush only, Turdus musicus, Linn.
is called mavis. The name is used by Chaucer, R. of Rose, 6193 and Spenser,

“ The Thrush replyes, the Mavis descant playes.'’ Epithal. 81.

“ fllaz'iscuaficednla, mawysse.’' Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII. “ Mauys, a byrde, mavuis.”

'2 It is evideut that the name of Mahomet became, as in old Freneh. a term denoting
any idol ; ns also mahomerie, in low Latin mahomeria, was used to signify the worship
of any false deity. Amongst the charges brought by the King of France against Pope
Bonisave YIlI. one was that he “haunted maumetriess' Langt. Chron. p. 320. ln
the version of the Ifflznuel des Pecclzes, R. Brunne uses the word, speaking of a “ prest
of Sarasyne‚’' who lived in ‘⁴ maumetry.'' HARL. MS. 1701, f. Q. See also R. Glouc.

Chron. Hall calls Perkin VVarbeck the Duchess of Burgundy‘s ‘⁴ newly-invented
mawmet,'' and speaks of him as the ‘¹ feyned duke—but a peinted image.‘’ The cir-
cumstance that this name was applied to him is shown likewise by the passage in Pat.

who “MichaeliJm-eph rebelli et prodilorz' vostro, aut cuidam idolo, sice simulacro,

Fahyan, relating the insurrections at Paris and Rouen in 1455, says that the men
of Rouen ‘⁸ made theym a mamet fatte and vuweldy. as a vylayne of the cytye, and
caryed him about the tou-ne in a carte, and named hym, in dyrysyon of theyr prynce,

3 “ Mawnde. ubi mete vesselle (escale.)'’ CATH. ANG. Caxton says, in the Book for
Travellers, “ Ghyselin the mande maker (corbillier) hath sold his vannes, his mandes
(corbillps) οι· corffes.” ‘¹ ssIamze, mande, a maunde, flasket‚ open basket, or pannier
having handles.'⁷ eoTu. This word is given by Ray, as used in the North, and noticed
likewise in the Craven Dialect. It is commonly used in Devon: see Palmer's Glos-
sary. Aug-San: mand, corbis. It seems, as Spelman has suggested, that the Maunday,
or dole distributed on Holy Thursday, derived its name from the baskets wherein it
was given, and not from the Latin mandatum. in allusion to the command of Christ, or
from the French mendz'er. See a full account of the customs on this occasion iu Brand‘s
Popular Antiquities. ‘⁴ Maundy thursday, ievuedy absolv.’' PALSG.
