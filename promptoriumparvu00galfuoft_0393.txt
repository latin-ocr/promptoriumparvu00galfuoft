¹ Camden, in his Remains, explains laund as signifying a plain among trees. Thus 111
the account of the hunting expedition, Ipornydon, 383, the Queen's pavillion was pitched
at a “ laund on hight,” whence she might command a view of all the gamo of the forest.

Shakespeare, Hen. VI. pt. i. III. 1. In Cullum's Hawsted a rental dated 1509 makes

³ “A lese, lax<c.'' CATH. ANG. “ Lesshe for a grehounde, lais, lesse.'' PALSG. In the
note on the word FUTE, p. 183, it was suggested that the term feuterer might thence
be derived; Sir F. Madden likewise, in llis Glossary to Gawayn, had explained “ Vewter,''

Gawayn and Grene Kny3t, 1146, as denoting the huntsman who tracked the deer by the '

fewte or odour. It seems probaffle, however, that the derivation given by Blount, Bp.
Kennett, and other glossarists, is more correct. The Gaulish hounds, of which Martial
and Ovid speak, termed vertayi, or veltres, appear to have been greyhounds‚ and hence
the appellations veltro, Ital. νὶιιιιίνε, vmcltre, Fr. Welter‚ Germ. The Promptorium gives
GREHOWNDE, veltres, p. 209; and from the practice of leading these dogs in eouples, the
leash appears to have received the name vello-ea, here given, a word unnoticed by Ducange.
The “ministerium de Velm-arici ” is mentioned 111 Rot. Pip. 5 Steph. In the Honschold
Constitutions of Hen. II. Liber Niger Scacc. i. 356, amongst the stipends assigned to the
different officers connected with the chace, is the statement, “ Vella-<criz'‚unusquisque iljd.
’ίιι (lie, et ijd. hominibus secis; et unicuique leporario ob. in clie.'' Blount has cited the
Tenure of Setene, in Kent, by the service of providing one vello-arius, to lead three grey-
hounds, when the King should go into Grascony, as appears by Esch. 34 Edw. I. and Rot.
Fin. 2 Edw. ΙΙ. where the word is written mutuno-tus. Various details regarding the
duties of the ‘⁴ foutreres,’' and their fee, or share of the produce of thc chace, will be
found in the Mayster of Game, Vcsp. B. x11. f. 99, 104, b. Of thc dogs terined veltres,
veltralti, νεὶ-(11191, &c. see further in Ducange, v. (Aonis. At a lator time the vazcllre was a
mongrel hound, used in hunting bears and boare, as Nicot ObscrveS, “ C'est ‘erne esphce de
clcz'en entre allant et maxtin, dont on chasse aua: oui-s et sanylz'ers.'' The feutcrers appear
to have been at a later period termed ‘·children of the lesh ;” they were four in
number in the household of Henry VIII. 1526, as appears-by the Ordinances of Elt-
ham.
