1 —rownde stone, or enne, Ms. of berth, s. of erthe, P. The term pellet, Fr. polone,
designated the stone balls‚ or missiles which were projected by the mangonels, and war-
like engines of early times, and by artillery, bullets of stone being disused only in the
XVIth cent. Missiles formed of indurated clay have also been found, the use of which is
perhaps indicated in the Promptorium. In Golagros and Gawane, v. 463, are mentioned
‘⁴ pellokis paisand,'' with ‘¹ gapand gunnis of brase ;''n and Chaucer uses the simile
‘⁴ swifte as a pellet out of a gonne.” House of Fame, ni. Horman says, ‘¹ The mes-
senger was slayne with a pellet, qlande‚’' and Hall speaks of shooting ‘⁴ great penedes,
whiche made a greate noyse.” Chron. ‘24 Hen. VIII. “A pelet of stone, or lede.
ylans.” CATH. ANG. “ Pellet‚ a rounde stone, plomme.'’ PALSG. See Mr. Archi-
bald‘s observations on stone shot found in the island of Walney, Archaeol. xxviii„ and
Mr. Porrett's notice of shot found in the Tower moat, Archaeol. xxx. Compare
CALYON. rounde stone, rudus, p. 58.

is described as alighting from his steed, when having been disarmed, he ‘¹ dude on a
robe of peolour.'⁷ v. 4129. See also the passages cited in the Glossary to Syr Gawayn.
Wicliffe, in the complaint to the King and Parliament, objects that the poor were con-
strained to provide a worldly priest in pride and gluttony ‘⁴ with fair hors and jouy, and
gay saddles and bridles ringing by the way, and himself in eostly cloths and pelure‚”
whilst they perished from cold and hunger. Hardyng speaks of the state of King
Arthur, who was attended by a thousand knights,

“ Clad all in graye of pelury preordinate,
That was full riche, accordyng to there estate.'’ Chron. e. 74.

³ “A pendande ofa belte, pendulum.'’ CATH. ANG. The rich decoration of the
extremity of the girdle appears on monumental effigies in great variety, and is fre-
