they should form a congregation, have a church for themselves. These hospitals were

of the Augustine order, and included amongst the religious houses which were surren-
dered 26 Henry VIII. The formalities with which the seclusion of lepers was effected,
and the restrictions imposed upon them, may be learned from the Manuale ad usum
Sarum. Hentzner, who visited England during the reign of Elizabeth‚ speaks of the
English as very subject to the disease of leprosy. ‘⁶ A lepyr‚ lepra, elefancia, missella.
A leprus man, leprosas, misellus.” CATH. ANG. Horman says, “ He hath made a leper,
or a lasar house; ltierocomz'on condiclit.’' “ Lepar, a sicke man, Zasdre. Lasar, id.
Lypre, the siekenesse, lasderie.'’ PALSG. The term mesel is very commonly used to desig-
nate a leprous person, and appears to be directly taken from the French mesel ,· some
writers have, however, supposed a distinction to have existed between mesella-ie and
Zadrerz'e. See MASYL, hereafter.

Frankel. T. 1106 3 and it signifies teaching, Vis. of Piers Ploughm. 4742, 9551 ς Townel.

found at Grundisburgh, Suffolk, dated 1501, to the memory of a person,

“ Which decessyd, as yee shall lere,
The vj. day off September.”

2 Les is used by R. Glouc. as an adjective3 as a substantive, lees, a falsehood., occurs
more frequently. Lese, Gawene and the Carle, 7, 265; “XVithouten lees,'’ Chaucer‚
