Iu the eomplaint of the Ploughman, given by Foxe, under the year 1360, it is said,
“though we preyen thee but a litle and shortlich‚ thou wilt thenken on vs, and grauuteu
vs that vs nedeth, for so thou behighted vs somtime:'' and again, ‘⁴ thou yhightest
some tyme, διο. He (the Pope) behoteth men the blisse of heauen, withouten any
peyne, that geuen him much money.'' Hote, signifying a promise, is used by R. Bruuue;
it occurs in the Townl. Myst. p. 46 ; and the verb, thou hete, het, or hight, thou didst
promise. By R. Glouc. and other writers to bote is used in the sense of to command, or
be called.

² This term, derived from Aug-Sex. hufa, cidaris, is used to denote head coverings
of almost every description. In the satirical song on the Consistory Courts in the time
of Edward Ι. Polit. Songs, ed. Wright‚ 156, it is said,

“ Furst ther sit an old eherle in a blake bure,
Of all that ther sitteth seemeth best syre.”

It signifies a cap of estate, as in the bequest of John Earl of WVarren, Surrey. and Strath-
orne, 1347: “Jeo dez-ys ὰ Δίοηεν. Will. cle ll'arenne mon filz ma hure ‹Vm-ssent (ἰωή-ἑ
pour Sco-acliorne ove le cerole d’aryent dom-e pour ycel.” Testam. Ebor. i. 413: Margaret

pannum de lak; temam (Ze cem'co; flameolccm clo crispo.’' &a Ibid. p. 221. In the
Vision of P. Ploughman, 418, allusion is made to the “ howves of selk,'' worn by ser-
jeants-at-law; and Chaucer, iu the Reve's Prol. 3909, uses the phrase ‘⁴ set his l1owve; ’'
aud speaks of “¹ an howve above a call.'' Troil. Β. iii. 775. In 1482. a petition was
preferred to Parliament by the craft of “liurers, cappers,'' &c. against the injurious
use of machinery‚ then introduced to supersede manual labour, by means of a falling
mill, whereby the quality of ·‘l1uers‚ bonettes, and cappos '' was slepreeiated. See Rot.
Pari. vi. 23:33 Stat. of Realm, *22 Edw. IV„ where they are termed ‘⁴ hurez, huretz‚''
