¹ “ Germinatus, commyn as malte.’' on'rus. Ham-ison, in his Description of Eng-
land, speaking of the making of malt, says that the grain is steeped, and the water
drained from it 3 it is then laid on the floor in a heap, ‘⁴ untill it be readie to shoote at
the root end, which maltsters call commyng. When it beginneth therefore to shoot in
this maner, they saie it is come, and then sorthwith they spread it abroad, first thicke‚
and afterward thinner and thinner vpon the said floore (as it commeth), and there it
lieth by the space of one and twentie dayes at the least.’' B. ii. 0. 6. Holinsh. i. 169.
R. Holine, among terms used by maltmakers, says that “the comeing of barley, or
malt, is the spritting of it, as if it cast out a root.'’ Acad. of Arm. Β. iii. p. 105. The
little sprouts and roots of malted barley. when dry, and separated by the sci-een, are
still called in Norfolk malt—cumbs‚ according to Forby. Bp. Kennett gives ‘⁶ Malt
eomes, or malt comings, the little beards or shoots, when malt begins to run, or come ;
Yorkshire.’' Lansd. MS. 1033. See Craven Glossary and Jamieson. Compare lsl.

2 The strange and superstitious notions that obtained in olden times regarding the
mandrake, its virtues, and the precautions requisite in removing it from the soil, are
recorded by numerous writers. In an Anglo-Saxon Herbal of the Xth cent. viteli.
C. 111. f. 53, v⁰‚ a representation will be found of the plant, at the side of which ap-
pears the dog, whose services were used in dragging it up. The account there given of
the herb has been printed by ΜΓ. Thorpe in 1115 Analecta. Alex. Neccham, who died 1297,
mentions it as if it had been commonly cultivated in gardens, which should be deeked, as
he observes in 1115 treatise de naturis rerum, ‘⁴ rosis et liliis, solsequfis, molis et mandra-
yoris.’‘ Roy. MS. 1⁶2 G. XI. f. 77. The author, however, of the treatise 011 the qualities
of hei-bs, written early in XVth cent.. who appears to have cultivated 111 1115 herber at
Stepney many botanical rarities, speaks of the ‘⁴ mandrage⁷' as a plant that he had
seen once only. He admits that as to any sexual distinction in the roots, ‘⁴ kynde
neuere 3af to erbe be forme and be kynde of man: some takyn seere rootys, and keruyn
swuche formys, as we han leryd of vpelonders ;'' Arund. MS. 42, f. 31, v0. The curious
relation that he gives of 1115 detection osan aged man, who kept in a strong chest a
mandrake root, which brought him daily ‘¹ a fayre peny‚'' is a remarkable illustration
ofthe credulity of the age. See further on this subject Roy. MS. 18 Α. VI. f. 83, v⁰;
Trevisa's version of Barthol. de Propr. B. xvij. 0. 104 ; Bulleine’s Bulwarke of Defence,
p. —ll 3 Browne's Vulgar Errors, and Philip's Flora Historica, i. 3⁶24. Singular re-
presentations of the ‘⁴ mandrayolo'' and ‘⁴ mandraqola‚'’ executed by an Italian de-
signer in the earlier part of the XVIth cent„ are preserved in the Add. MS. 5981,
f. 195 and 129, v0. The dog drags up the monstrous root by a chain attached to its ancles,
whilst his master stops his ears, to escape the maddening effects of the mandrake’s screams.
