of Abp. Peclzham‚ 1280, which sets forth the articles to be provided by the parishioners,
these bells are designated as ‘⁴ cctmpance manuales pro mortuis.'’ Wilk. Conc. ii. 49. Of
the local use of the term lich-gate, signifying the outer gate of the cemetery, beneath
which the corpse is placed, whilst awaiting the officiating minister, see the Glossary of
Architecture, Cheshire and Shropshire Glossaries. In the WVest, the path hy which the
corpse is carried to the grave is known as the leach-way3 in Cheshire it is called the lich-
road. Coles gives ‘⁶ lich fowles, carcass bird, scritch-owls, night-ravens.”

¹ The term liege is commonly used by the old writers in the two-fold sense which is
here given to it, denoting both the chief and the subject, as bound by the hyantia, or
bond whereby they were reciprocally connected. Palsgrave gives only “ Lege lorde,
εοαεναψι, lz'eye.” See Spelman and Ducange, v. Lz'yius.

2 LEDER, MS. Lither, or 1idder, has in the North the signification of idle or sluggish.
In the Vis. of P. Ploughman the expression ‘⁶ luther sleuthe '³ occurs ; and ‘⁶ lithere ” in
King Estmere. One of the evils of the times enumerated in the curious lines, Roy. MS.
7 A. VI. f. 38, b. is that ‘⁴ Lex is layde, and lethyrly lukes.'' Tusser speaks of the un-
profitableness of the “ litherly lubber.'’ Lyndsay uses the word ‘⁶ lidder '' in the sense of
backward or shy, which approaches more nearly to that assigned to it in the Promptorium.
“Desz'dz'ezcx‚ idle, lazie, lither, slouthfull. Iynave, lazy, lither,'' &Q (τοῖσι. “ Lither,
finyzwcl, festard, ficineant, nice, oisz‘f, pccreSseux.'’ SEREW. See Brockett‚ v. Lither, and
Jamieson‚ v. Lidder.

³ In the description of the march of Alexander’s army the poet describes the various
classes of which the host was composed‚ high and low, knight and knave,

‘¹ Mony baroun, ful wel y-thewed‚
Mony ledron, mony schrewe.'⁷ K. Alis. 3210.

Weber explains the word ledron as signifying here a leper, or a mean person. Skelton
uses the word, in the poem entitled Slaunder, and false detractions.

‘⁴ But my learning is of an other degree,
To taunt theim like lyd drons, lewde as they be.''

“Laiderom somewhat ugly‚ pretty and foule.’' corG. It must, however, be observed
that as lidorus has not been found in the Latin glossarists, it cannot be asserted positively
that LYDR5N is to be taken in this sense in the Promptorium.

⁴ The term ‘⁵ lithes‚'⁸ occurring in Havelok, 2163, is explained by Sir F. Madden as
