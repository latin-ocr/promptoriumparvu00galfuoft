it is stated that Sir William Drury possessed ‘¹ Scitum manerii, &c. uno 18 111018 circum-
jacente, uno le trae-cs ante portam messuagii predicti. et unam magnam curiam undique
bene edificataxn.’' Cullum’s Hawsted, p. 142. Sir T. More was so greatly in favor
during 20 years of his life at the court of Henry VIII. that, as Roper says, “a good part
thearof used the kinge uppon holie daies, when he had donne his owne devoffions, to sende
for him into his traverse, and theare, sometimes in matters of Astronomy‚ Geometry, Divi-
nity, and suche other facusties, and sometimes of his worldly affaires, to sit and converse
with him.’' In this and other instances a traverse seems to have been a kind of state pew,
or closet. So likewise we read that when Queen Elizabeth visited Cambridge in 1564, on
the south side of the chapel at King's College was hung a rich Travas of crimson velvet
for the queen's majesty3 and when she entered the chapel‚ desiring to pray privately, she
‘¹ went into her Travys, under a canopy.'' Le Keux, Mem. of Camb. vol. ii. King's Coll.
pp. 20, 21. Thus also Fabyan relates that the king coming to St. Paul's “ kneled in a
trauers purueyed for hym ’' near the altar. Chron. 9 Hen. VI. A Traverse is explained
in the Glossary of Architecture as having been a screen with eurtains, in a hall, ehapel,
or large chamber.

¹ “ A trave for to scho horse in, Fe77·atorz'um.'' CATH. ANG. This term, it will be remem-
bered‚ is used by Chaucer, in his description of the Miller‘s young wife, where he says—
“ she sprong as a 8011 in 3 traue ¹³ (rhyming to save). Miller's Tale. This is doubtless the
frame used for confining an unruly horse whilst being shod. According to Forby, a
smith's shoeing shed is called in Norfolk a Traverse. Edm. Heyward, of Little YValsing-
ham, blacksmith, bequeaths to his wife. in 1517, ‘⁶ my place wich is called the house at
the travesse.'' a term which may probably have been connected with that occurring above.

2 Antitodnm, MS. and 5. Ρ. The composition of various kinds of ΤΙιενῑάσα, 311 antidote for
bites of serpents and venomous animals‚is given by Pliny and other writels. Scribonius Lar—
gus speaks of it as made of the flesh of vipers. In the Middle Ages it was highly esteemed
against poison, venom of serpents, and certain diseases; the nature of the nostrum may be
learned from ancient medicinal treaffises, such as Nic. de Hostrffiham's Amidam-ium,
Sloane MS. 341. The Treacle of Genoa appears to have been in very high repute; its
virtues are thus extolled by Andrew Borde, physician to Henry VII. “Whan they do
make theyr treacle a man wyll take and eate poysen and than 118 wyl swel redy to horst
and to dye, and as sone as he hath takyn trakle he is hole agene.'' Boke of the Introd.
of Knowledge‚ 1542. Thus also says Caxton, in the Book for Travellers‚ “ of bestes,
venemous serpentes, lizarts, scorpions, flies, wormes, who of thise wormes shall be byten he
must 113118 triacle, ys not that he shall deye 1³³ We cannot marvel that costly appliances
were often provided wherein to carry so precious an antidote, so as to be constantly at
hand, such as the ‘⁴ pixis argenti ad tiriacam‚'’ Close Roll 9 Joh. ; the “ Triacle box du
pere apelle une Hakette, garniz d'or,'' among the precious effects of Henry V.; the Godet,
holding treacle, the gift of John de Kellawe, found with relies and offerings to the shrine
of St. Cuthbert at Durham, in 138& and the “ Trocleere argenteum et deauratum cum
costis de birall‚’¹ bequeathed by Isslenry, lord Scrope in 1415 to his sister. A curious illus-
tration of the great esteem in which Treacle of Genoa was held, and of the difficulty of
obtaining it unadulterated, occurs in the Paston Letters, vol. iv. p. 2643 and in 1479,
during the great sickness in England, John Paston entreats his brother Sir John to send
him speedily ‘⁴ 11 pottys of tryacle of Jenne, they shall coste xvj.d.—the pcpyll dyeth
