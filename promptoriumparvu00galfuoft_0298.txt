Dietionary of John de Garlandia, printed in the Collection of documents relating to
French history, Paris, 1837, there is an enumeration of weapons and engines of war,
used at the siege of Toulouse‚ in 1218: the writer says that 110 saw “ secures, bipenne-5,
‹racltaycsa Galaesum, malleius et pvylwes, cum dolonibus, avelancz'as Angylicorum (anela-
cz'as,al. MS.) pila Ii’mnwmrunz, ‹t‘·c.” The MS. at Rouen gives the following reading,
“secures Duvclwshjawa G‹(llic07·um.'' But, although the gisarnie seems in these passages
to be appropriated asaGaulish weapon, Wace, in the Roman de Rou, written about
1160, repeatedly describes the English in Harold’s army as armed with sharp gisarmes
and hatehets, whereas their opponents fought with long lances and swords. See lin.
1290& 12928, 13‚437. It ma)v be observed‚ however, that on the Bayeux tapestry
the Saxone are represented as combating with the heavy axe, but no weapon appears
which resembles the gisarme. In the Royal mandate, 36 Hen. III. 1252, printed by
XVats at the end of his edition of M. Paris, the sheriffs are commanded to assemble all
persons troni the age of 15 to 60, and cause them “jurare ad α7·ηιιι,” according to the
amount of their lands and ehattels3 those who were rated under 40 Shillings land,
or from 40 shillings to 1⁴¹ marks ehattels, “jurati sunt (αῖ ficlcess,yz'surmas, cultellos et
alia urina on‘z‘nnuta.'' From this document, and the stat. Wint. 13 Edw. I. 0. 6, 1285,
it is apparent that the gisarme was one of the weapons in ordinary 1150 among the inferior
ranks of the English army. See Stat. of Realm. i. 97. A curious description of the
conflict of the King of Nineveh, armed with ‘¹ gysarme and sweord botlie‚” occurs in
the Romance of vang Alis. line 2302. See also Havelok. 255& Ritson’s Metr. Ix'om.;
Chaucer, R. of Rosea, 5975. The giearme was used in England as late as the battle of
Flodden‚ 15133 it was of two kinds, 30001 ding- to Sir S. Meyrick, nanie15‚ the glaive
gisarnie, and the hill ,ιε-,15311110 ς the distinctim mark of the weapon being a spike rising at
the back, as may be seen in Grose's Arniour, pl. 28, and Skelton's Illustr. of the Arnioury
at Goodrieh Court, ii. pl. 84, 85.

‘2 'she gyterne, getron, or eittern, Fr. yuiterne, was a stringed instrument, which

favour, probably as an aeeompaniment to the voice. In the Lat. Eng. voeabulary, Roy.

with the former there is seen an instrument with five strings, and the head reeurved,
which perhaps exhibits the form of the gyterne at that early period. In default of any
positive information on the uls-cure subject of the early history of musio, it may be
stated, eonjevturally, that the g>terne is the instrument which was held in an horizontal
position, and played either by hand or with 3 plectrum, as may be seen in almost every
