279, f. 25. Skinner derives the word from Ang.-Sax. helan, (effere. “ Hull of a beane
or pese, eseosse. Hull or barcke of a tree, escorce.” PALSG. “ Goasse, the huske, swad,
cod, hull of beanes, pease‚'’ &c- COTG. Gerarde says that Anemo nuda is called in
Nox-soll< and Suffolk ‘⁶ unhulled otes.” In the Craven dialect, the hull is the skin of a
potatoe, or the husk of a nnt, and to hull signifies to peel off the husk of any seed: in
Hampshire the husk of corn 15 termed the hull. “ Follicula uvarum, the huskes, 11111105,
01· skinnes of grapes, Pericarpizmt,folliculus, siliqua, the huske or hull, inclosing the
seede.'' Junius' Nomencl. by Higins.

¹ “ To 11010, cavare, perforare, «stc. ubi to thyrle.’' CATH. ANG. “ Ραῐανθ. cavare, forare,
Anylice to hole, or to bore.'' Equiv. John de Garlandia. ‘A.-S. holian, excavare.

² The primary meaning of the Ang.-Sax. word Holm appears to he water or ocean;
it implies also a river island, or a level meadow, especially near a stream. It is recorded
in the Sax. Chron. A.D. 903, that a great fight occurred between the Kentish men and
the Danes “aet bum Holme,'' but the precise locality has not been ascertaiued. Holm
signifies also an elevated spot, as in the instance ot' the Steep-holm, so called by way of
distinction from the Flat-holm, islands in the mouth of the Severn. Leland, in his
Comm. in Cygn. cant. (ltin. ix. 59‚) would derive Dzmolmus. Durham, from dune, a
11111, and holme, which he interprets thus: ‘⁶ Holme vero eminentis loci, iata-dm et
sylvest, et aquis circumsepti verticem, (cut eminentiam eccprz‘mz't.'’ Bp. Kennett has
the following remarks: ‘⁶ Homes. properly 11011115, which signified originally river-islands‚
or green islands surrounded by running streame ; from a resemblance whereof meadows
and pasture grounds are in some places called Homes. A meadow by the late Abbey of
St. Austin's‚ Canterbury, was commonly called North-homes 3 and a flat pastui-e in Roinney
Marsh ’15 yet called the Holmes. &c. An Holm, an island, Westm.; hence Holme-
cultram, Holmby 1101150, &c. Mill—holme, watery places about a mill dam, from mill, and
Sax. holm, which signifies two things, as a hill or rising ground, and a green island, or
place almost enclosed with water3 from whence the name of many plac-es almost sur-
rounded with water, as Axholm, Evesholm, corruptly Evesham, &c. The howmes, a
green piece of ground near Thirske in Yorkshire‚ lying between tlie river Codbeek and
the brook called Sewel.'' Lansd. MS. 1033. In Lineolnshire‚ as especially near the
Trent. the name is frequent3 as likewise in Norfolk, and in the vieinity of Lynn, and
denotes both low pastures¹ and elevations of trifling magnitude, but which were perhaps
insulated, before draining had been effected. Simon Earl of IIuntingdon, who founded
St. Andrew's Priory. Northampton, about 1081. granted “tres dulos prati, et rmum
lmlmwn;” and in the donation of H. de Pynkeneye to Canons' Ashhy, in 1298, 110
bestowed “totam pasturam illam que vocatur le 11111105, cnm duobus kelmis ίιι campis
Wedone et W'estone.'' Mon. Aug. i. 680, iii. 292.
