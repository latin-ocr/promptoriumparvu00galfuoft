¹ ‘⁴ Gz'ronomon (a keruere) mensis, lectis assistit ales->tes (a surgyone. or a chamber-
leyne.)'’ Distigius, Harl. MS. 1002, f. 113. The functions of the treme-heator, or §castr
trenchsml, at the table of the sovereign or noble, were regarded as of an honourable
nature, and regulated by prescribed ceremonial. The details thereos¹ may be learned
from the Household Ordinances of the English Court, published by the Ant. Soc.; the
ceremonial of the inthronization of Abp. Neville, 1466, Leland, Coll. vi.; the order for
the government of a nobleman's house, 1605, Archaeol. xiii. 315, and similar documents.
At the coronation of Henry IV. the office of carver was claimed by the Earl of Somerset,
half-brother to the King, in right of his earldom of Lincoln3 and on ordinary occasions
the office was discharged by Bannerets, or Knights bachelors, who were called Knights of
chamber, or, in their absence, by the Knights of household. See Liber Niger Edw. IV.
Househ. Ord. 32. The Lords Henry Neville and Clinton were the chief carvers at the
court of Henry VIII. 1526 ; and at all times the office seems to have been held by men
of rank, and was conferred by patent. See the Treatise cle scz'ssmri, ciborum, et servicio
domimorum diversis temporibus, Sloane MS. 1986, t. Hen. VI. especially the chapter de
cultellis domini, in the Treatise de officiariis in curiis dominorum, which has been edited
by Mr. Halliwell for the Percy society, Boke of Curtasye, p. 28. The minor details of
the craft are given in the Boke of Kerving, W. de Worde, 1508. “ Karuer afore a Prince,
Escvc'eo· trenclmnt. I kerue as a lordes karuer dothe at his table, Ie trenclze. I put the
towell aboute a karuer or a seruer's necke, that shall seruc a greate man at his table,
Ie encolle la touaille.'’ PALSG. The proceeding to which allusion is here made was con-
ducted with ceremony, and was termed arming the carver3 see Lel. Coll. vi. 7 ; Arehaeol.
xiii. 332. At certain times both the carver and sewer performed their services kneeling
on one knee, as represented in the illumination which exhibits the death of Earl Godwin
at the table of Edward the Confessor, Vitell. A. xm. engraved in Strutt’s Regal Anti-

uities, plate 2.

q ² Pella-is appears to have been a helm of leather, which was called also a palet, a word
occurring in the Promptorium. By Ugutio it is explained to have been “ yalea ex corio
vel pelle,'' to which, in the Ortus, is added, “Anqlke, a helme of lether. Galerus, a
coyfe of lether.” lb. Sir W. Langford, in 1411, bequeaths to his son a “ haberion‚''
and a ‘⁶ ketill hatte‚” which is considered by Sir S. Meyrick to have been identical with
the visored capelline, or steel hat, represented in Crit. Enquiry, ii. pl. 48. It would
appear from the Promptorium that the kettle hat was exclusively formed of leather ; it
is, however, probable that the name was likewise given to the chapel (le fer, or capellus
ferreus, used from the time of Edw. Π. until the XVIth cent. the form being at all times
