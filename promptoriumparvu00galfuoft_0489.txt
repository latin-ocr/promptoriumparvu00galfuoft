MS. 18 A. XII. are enumerated the machines and great shot with which a legion was
provided, such as “ spryngoltes, tripgettes, bowes of brake, arblastes bende‚ &c. the
strengthe and myghte of his shot may nothing with-stonde, neyther hors man with
plates and haberions, ne foot man with paves and shelde.” B. ii. c. 24. Again they are
mentioned as wall-shields, of which kind a curious specimen formed ofiron is preserved
in the porter’s lodge at VVarwick castle. “ It nedethe bat ther be good plentie of targes,
pauysses, and sheldes in be citie, to keuer and to hin or stop the gappes of the enbatil-
mentes of be walles fro shot.'⁷ B. iv. 0. 6. They are also mentioned as useful in sea-
fights. In the passage of arms between Lord Scales and the Bastard of Burgundy,
A.D. 1467, it is said, ‘⁴ We shalle doo armes on foote--and shalle mowe bere a targe
or a pavis, aftir the wille and pleasire of everich of us.’' Lansd. MS. ⁶285 ; in the

A.D. 1459, was “ j. rede pavys. Item, j. target.’' Archaeol. xxi. 27⁶2. The pavyce
was retained in use after the adoption of fite-arms. Thus Hall, in his account of the
battle at Flodden, 1513, describes the furious fire kept up by the artillery on both sides:
‘⁴ And after the shotte was done, which they (the Scotch ?) defended with pauishes, they
came to handestrokes.'' ‘⁴ quea, a pauys.’⁷ Harl. MS. 1002), f. 15⁶2. “ A pavysse,

17 C. XVII. In the Eqnivoca of Joh. de Garlandifi, with the interpretations of
Master Geoffiy, probably the compilet of the Promptorium, it is said that “ferula est
instrumentum quo discipuli percutiuntur in manibus, quod et alio nomine palmatorium
appellatur. Anylz'ce a palmer.” “ A palmarein be scole‚ferula‚ hortatorium, palma-
torium.'’ CATH. ANG. “ Ferula, arod or stycke wherwith ehildern’s handes be striken
in scholes, a palmer.‘' ELYOT.
