i. 276. This bird, as likewise the parrot, seems to have been a favourite ornament, in-
troduced on tapestry or embroidered works. It is again mentioned in the Inventory of
Sir John Fastolfe's effects, taken 1459, “Clothis of Arras, and of Tapstre warke.
Item, ij. clothis portrayed full of popelers ;'' and again, in one of the bed-chambers,
‘¹ Item. j. hangyng clothe of Popelers.'’ Archaeol. xxi„ pp. 253, 264. It appears sub-
sequently that the Pom: LERE was considered by the compiler of the Promptorium to be
the same as the shoveler-duck, Anas clypeata, Linn. ; and it may be observed that in
medieval decorations such birds were not unfrequently represented, as appears by the
Caistor inventory, above cited, the vestments discovered at Durham, attributed to St.
Cuthbert‚ and the entry in the Bursar's accounts, given by Mr. Raine, respecting an
altar there, on “ le rerdos ” of which were depicted the eider-ducks, termed the birds
of St. Cuthbert.

¹ For-by gives the words Poppin, a puppet, and poppin-shew. as still retained in use
in Norfolk. He supposes it to be derived from ‘⁶ Popin, spruce, neat, briske, prettie.'’
co‘rG. It may more properly, perhaps, be derived from poupon, a baby. ‘⁴ Popet for
childre to play with, povpe‘e.” PALSG.

² ‘⁴ Porray, porreta, porraca.⁹' CATH. ANG. This term implies generally pease
pottage, still called in French parite, and the treatises on ancient eookery contain
numerous recipes for its concoction. See the instructions of the chief master-cook of
Richard 11., regarding “ Perrey of pesone,'⁷ Forme of Cury, p. 39, and the recipe for
‘⁶ Blaunche perreye,‘’ Harl. MS. 2⁷79, f. ⁶25. It has, however, other significations. In
the Canterbury MS. of the Medulla occurs “porrata, porrey,'' with this marginal ad-
dition, attributed to Somner, ‘⁴ gesoden wyrt mete.’' According to the Ortus it seems
to have denoted a pottage of leeks, “poratum esc cibus de poris factus, Anqlice por-
raye3 ” and in a curious MS. at Middle Hill, formerly in the Heber Collection, 8336,
it appears that the dish called ⁴‘ rampaunt poree '’ was chiefly compounded of pears.
Poreta or poirata signify, according to Ducange, leek-pottage‚ and likewise the vege.
table called beet, in French poiree, or porree. It is related in the Golden Legend that
St. Bernard was so frugal that often he made pottage of holm leaves 3 whereat a de-
moniac being brought to him, the evil spirit thus reviled the saint: ‘⁴ Thou eter of
