¹ The drift of the forest, agyz'talz'o animalium in foresta, is a legal term which
implied a view taken of the cattle feeding in the chase, forest, or waste, at certain
seasons when they were driven into an enclosure‚ in order to aseertain whose they were,
and whether legally commonable. The Stat. 32 Hen. VIII. e. 13, among various
clauses, devised for the improvement of the breed of horses, directs the drift to be
made at Michaelmas, and other convenient times, and under-sized horses to be destroyed.
The word is used by Horman metaphorically‚ in its more ordinary acceptati0n‚ “ subtyle
dryftis (callida consilia) ought nat to sette a iudge out of the ryght wey.” Elyot renders
“ adpulsas, the dryfte of shepe to the water.''

² ⁴⁴ To dryte, cacare, eya-eres* CATH. ANG. In the Wicliffite version, Phil. iii. 8,
is thus rendered ; ‘⁴ I deme alle thingis as drit ; ’' and the word occurs also in Wicliffe's
“objections of FrereS. Freres setten more by stinking dritt of worldly goods, then
they don by virtues, and goods of bliss.'' See Jamieson’s observations on the etymology
of the verb to drite, exonerare vento-em. Ang. Sax. gedritan, cacare. .-

³ Hornian speaks of „a dryuyl or a drudge: he is a very dryuell, sterquilinium.”
junius gives in this sense “ drivell or droile, mastiyia‚ qai ubique expulsas abacletsque
est. Belg. drevel.” See droile in ,Jamieson's Dietionary. Tusser, in his Points of
Huswffery, speaks of an under servant in the dairy termed a droy, or droie, whose duties
appear to have been similar to those of the DEYE, described in the note on that word.

‘⁵ Good droy to serve hog, to help wash, and to milk,
More needfull is truly, than some in their silk.''
