other jewel and hostelment that were mine other husbands goods and mine,’' as
stated in her protest. Hist. of Hengrave, 93. John Hakone of XVyneton makes the
following devise in 14373 “I wyll that alle nccessaries and hustylments longyng to
myn howsehold, that is to sey, to halle, chaumbyr‚ and kechene be disposed to the
use of my wife.'' Norwich Wills, Harl. MS. 10, f. 267. In the Paston 11011015, 11. 26,

foole yt cuttcth his garments. Iagge, a cuttyng‚ chicquetare. If Ι iagge my cappe, thou

him by the clcrk of Richard's household.
