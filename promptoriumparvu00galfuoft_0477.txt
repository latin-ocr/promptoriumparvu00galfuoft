In the relation given by Stowe of the combat

in Smithfield before Henry VI. 1442, between John de Astley (whom he calls Ansley or
Antsley) and aknight of Arragon‚ it is related that the latter with his axe “stroke
many strokes hard and sore vpon his hasenet, and on his hand, and made him loose and
let fall his axe to the ground, and brast vp his vmbar three· times, and caught his
dagger, and would haue smitten him in the faee.'’ Annales, p. 383, ed. 1631. In the
Survay of London, B. iii. this word is misprinted ‘⁴ brake up his uniber.⁷' From this
passage it seems to be evident that the OWMBRER was a defence that covered the face,
but it is not clear in what respect it differed from the visor, with which in previous
times the basinet had been furnished, when used without the tilting helm. 0‘ Umbrell

‘2 See Tyrwhitt⁷s Glossary, v. Nompere; Chaucer‚ Test. of Low, i. 319. It occurs also
in Vis. of Piers P. v. 3149, signifying an arbitrator. “ An ovrnper‚ impar.’⁷ cATH. ANG.

³ In the other MSS.. as likewise in the printed editions, this word is written owner.
lt must be observed‚ however, that the verb to owe, A.⁵Sax. agan. possidere, now
written own, occurs very frequently. Bp. Hall speaks of the Deity as ‘⁴ the great
ower of heaven.’⁷ Sermon at Exeter, Aug. 16:37.

“¹ R. anne, in his version of Langtoft⁷s Chron. p. 339, relates how Sir John de
’Waleiffi being taken prisoner, was hung at London :

“ Siben lete him doun eft, and his hede of snyten,
And born to London brigge fulle hie with outheys.”

Armed complaint‚ outhees, and fiers outrage.” Cant. Tales, v. 2014
