Anyl. apud quem solum occurrit, exp. pinquis, obesus, q. cl. crassius, a Lat. crassus.”
It is perhaps more direct'ly corrupted from the old Freneh word crus, which has the

same signification.

¹ In a MS. of the Medulla in the Editor's possession, cremium is rendered “a cra-
conum of grece or talwhe.'' “ Extrema crematio cepi, vel illud quod relinquitur ustum

iu, foixorioff' omns.

“A crakane, cremium.’' CATH. ANG. The term eracldings,

which occurs in the Seotch Acts, t. James VI. is explained by Jamieson as signifying the
refuse of melted tallow3 Su. G. and Isl. krak, quisquiliae, from krekia, to throw away.
Tallow craps has a like meaning in the Craven dialect.

² Creel is given by Moore as a word not frequently used 111 Suffolk ; Forby does not
mention it, but it occurs 111 the Craven dialect, and signifies an ozier basket, or crate.
See Jamieson's Dictionary. Roquefort explains creil as signifying a hurdle, craticula.

LEPE occurs hereafter.

³ See hereafter REMYK, as ale, or other lycoure.
⁴ Precyoustone, MS. “ Crapaude, a precious stone, c7·apazc„‹'ine.'' PALSG. cotgrave
explains crupuudlue as signifying the stone 011010111113, or the toad-stone. The precious

stone found, as it was asserted, in the head of a mad, was supposed to possess many
virtues, and especially ns a preservative against poison. On some of these stones, 30-
cording to Albertus Magnus, the figure of the animal was imprinted; these were of
a green colom, and termed crapuucliua, being possibly the kind here called suum-(lydus,
a name which properly dcnotes the emm-ald. These stones were known also by the
appellations (torax, hvonlz'u, chalonitis, nise, batruclcites, or ceraunia. In the Meti-ical
Romance entitled Emare is described a rich vesture, thickly set with gems, rubies,
topaze, “ crapowtcs and nakctte ;'’ the word is also written “erapawtes.” More de-
tailcd information 011 this subject will bc found in Gesner, dc quadrup. ovip. ii. G.
