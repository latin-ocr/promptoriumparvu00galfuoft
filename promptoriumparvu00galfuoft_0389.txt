¹ The word lap, according to many ancient writers, signified the skirt of a gai-ment.
Thus G. de Bibelesworth says,

“ Car par <levant ave: eskours (lappes,)
Ec d'em coste sont vos yirozzns (sidgoren.)'’

It denoted likewise the hinder skirt, as in Seuyn Sages, 899, where the herdsman is de-
scribed as pieking haws, and filling with them first his “ barm,” and afterwards “his
other lappe.’' In Emare also, v, 652, Egarye, being oruelly exposed with her child, eon-
ceals her face ‘⁶ with the hynther lappes '’ of her large and wide sureote. See moreover
Amis and Amssoun, 988 ; Chaucer, Clerk’s Tale, 8461. In the Life of St. Dominio, in
the Golden Legend, it is related that on a certain occasion, when the friars had little
bread, there came two young men, “ whiehe entred into the refectorye or fraytour, and
the lappes of theyr mantells yt henge on theyr neeke were full of breed,’' which they
gave to the Saint. “ Lappe, or skyrt, 93s7·07z.” PALSG. “ Gabinus, a garment with two
lappes, wherof the one cast baekward‚’' διο. ELYOT. Ang..Sax. lappa, fimbrias. The
word is also used, by analogy, to denote the lower part of the ear: ‘⁴ A lappe of ye ere,
cartilayz'a, leyz'a.'' CATH. ANG. Horman says that “ yf the lappe of the earo wax redde,
there is somewhat amysse. Lab«) rubescente aliquod peccatum esest

² “ Plioo, to folde, or lappe. Volvo, to turne or lappe.'' MED. “ Obvolvo, to lappe
about. lnvolntzcs, ί. circumdatas, lapped or wrapped. Involutio, a lappynge in. Epiphz'o,
i. equum totaliter ornare, lappynge of a horse.” ORTUS. “To lappe, volvere, convolvere.
To lapp in, intricare, involvere. A lappynge in‚'' διο. ΟΑΤΗ. ANG. This verb is used
most commonly in the sense of wrapping, as a garment. See Cheuelere Assigne, p. 101 3
Wicl. version, Math. xxvii. 59 ; Gower, Conf. Am. ; Cov. Myst. p. 125. In the Wieliffite
version it is written repeatedly ‘⁶ wlappe‚'' as in Isaiah xxxvii. 1, “ Whanne Kyng Ezeehie
hadde herd, he to rent hise debis, and he was wlappid in a sak (obvolutus est sacco‚’'
Vulg.) See also Job, iii. 5; Mark, xv. 46. John Paston writes to his wife, about 1490,
for a plaster of her “flos unyuentorum,'' to be applied to the knee of the Attorney-general,
to whom he was under obligation: and bids her write “ whethyr he ust lape eny more
elothys aboute the playster to kepe it warme‚ or nought.'' Paston L ters, v. 346. To
bi-lappe signifies to smround, or close in. Sir Amiloun in a dream saw his brother
Amis “bilappid among his fon.'' Amis and Amiloun, 1014. Hampole uses the com-
pounded word “ umbilape '' (Ang.-Sax. umbe, ymb, circum), as in the Priek of Conscienee,
where he says amongst the pains of hell, that the “vermyne salle vmbelape baim all
abowte.'' Harl. MS. 6923, f. 94. Latimer‚ in his Vth sermon on the Lord's Prayer, says,
“ Note here that our Saviour biddeth us to say, us; this us lappeth in all other men
with my prayer.'' Palsgrave gives the following phrases: “ Lappe this chylde well, for
the weather is colde, emcelopez bien, διο. Lappe this hoode aboute your head, affecblez
voees de ce chaperowss' ‘¹ Pllsser, to plait, fould, lap up, or one within another, whence
also to plash.” COTG. To lap is still used in the sense of wrapping‚ in lVarwickshire.
