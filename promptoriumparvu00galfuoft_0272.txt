¹ Conowre, 115. See hereafter TONOWRE of fonel. In Norfolk, according to Forby,
1118 181111 111 ordinary use is 111111181, Ang.-Sax. taeneL canistm'at. The word funnel ap-
pears to be derived fromfztnclnlus‚ “ quasi fundle,'’ as ,lunius observes. “Infusort'wn
est quoddam vasculum per quod liquor infunditur in aliud 2·os‚· ’σεί est vas in quo est
oleum quod ponitur iu lucernis, a fonell dyshe (αῖ. tonnell dysshe.)¹’ ORTUS.

² J unius thinks that this term was borrowed from the Italian forciore, which is ren-
dered by W. Thomas, in his Italian Grammar‚ 1548, “a 10158118, 01 a little coafer;''
and by Florio, ‘⁴ a foreet, a eoffin, a casket, a cabinet, &c.” It may be remarked that
the most elegant caskets of the Middle Ages, usually of bone or ivory, euriously carved
and painted, are, with few exceptione, of Italian workmanship; but as Flauders also
furuished these and numerous other ornamental applianees, the origin of the name
forcere may perhaps be sought in the Belg. fortsier‚ a banded eoffer. The importation
of “ascune 9111111078 ware slepaima forcers, caskettes, &c.” was forbidden by stat. 3
Edw. IV. c. 4, A.D. 1463. In William and the Werwolf it is related that the Queen
sought by means of a ring to eharm the monster.

“ Sebe feibli of a forcer a fair bok 58118 rau3t,
And radde ber on redli ri3t a long while.’'

Chaucer says in “ La belle Dame sans Me2·cie,''

‘⁴ Fortnne by strength the forcer hath vnshete,
VVherein was sperde all my worldly richesse.'' V. 65.

Caxton, in the Book for Travellers, says, ‘⁴ The joyner made a forcer for my loue, her
8118518, her seyrney 2472 forcier, sa luysel, son cserin. Set your jewellis in your forcier,
that they bo not stolen.'' Palsgrave gives “ f0(r)sar‚ or casket, escrain; fo(r)eer, a little
cosor, cqr'rce,” and cqffnl is rendered by Cotgrave “ a 81151181, cabinet, forset, (sic) &c.”

³ This word is taken from the French forces, shears for clipping wool or eloth.
