When Philip Augustus fell into the river, in consequence of the breaking of the bridge
of Gisors, Mareadeus, a captain in the host of King Richard, according to Langtoft’s

account, derided him thus3

“ Sir Kyng rise xp and skip, for hou has wette lai hater,
βου fisshes not werbe a leke, rise and go thi ways,
For hou has wette bi breke, §client is bi hernays.'' R. Brunne, p. 204.

So likewise 111 the Romanoa of Kyng Alisaunder‚ the word signifies garments‚ attire:
see lines 4264, 70543 and the Brahmins are said to live in austere penanee, ‘⁶ thinnelich
y-liatered,” line 5922. Ang.—Sax. haetero, vestitus. In the Vision of P. Ploughman,
Haukyn makes the following excuses for his soiled garment.

“ Ι have but oon hool hater, quod Haukym

I am the lasse to blame,
Though it be soiled and selde 919119 :
Ι slepe therinne o nyghtes.'' line 8900.

as a horse by too much riding, or any utensil by too much leading is hattered about:
Kent. Isl. haettur. 22m·‹‘czt,losus.”

¹ “ I haue 191191, i’affme mycvlar, i'az' plus chier. Many men had leuer se a play, than
to here a masse.’' PALSG. This word is used very commonly by the old writers. Ang.-
Sax. leof, caras, syrulus, comp. leofra. See LEFE, and dere.

² This verb occurs commonly 111 a composite form, to en-hance, or in-hanee, as in
the Vision of P. Ploughman, the wieliffite version, and Chaucer. The lintel of a door is
tcrmcd, from its pozifflon, the haunce. “Limen signifieth not only the tin-ashold of a
doure, but also the haunse. δῖ’]ιωϊίῖἰῖιηι, the haunse whyche is ouer the doure. IIy-
7„ sibaron, transumpte, or liaunce.” ELYOT. In the Nomenelator of Junius, translated by
lligins, a distinction is male between the Vitruvian term hyperthyrum, and svpercc'lz'wn,
