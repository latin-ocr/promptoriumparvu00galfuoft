¹ “ Lanuyo, i. lana super poma, vel flos tribuli qui postquam bene siccatus est levi-flam
effertur ιἰι aerem.'' CATH. In the Promptorium an allusion is made to another and strange
supposition regarding the production of gossamer, noticed by Skinner, namely, that it was
formed from the dew scorched by the morning sun, and thence, as it seems, termed here

corruption. It is evident from Chaucer that this phenomenon had exercised the ingenuity
of curious observers in ancient times.

“As sore wondren som on cause of thonder,
On ebbe and fioud, on gossomer, and on mist,
And on all thing, til that the cause is wist.'' Squiere’s T. 10‚572.

An allusion to the anciently received notion occurs in Spenser, who speaks of

“ the fine nets which oft we woven see
Of scorehed dew.’'

“ As light and thin as cobwebs that do fly
In the blew air, caus'd by the autumnal sun,
That boiis the (1811Γ 11181 011 1118 earth doth lie;
May seem this whitish rug then in the 5811111,
Unless that wiser men make't the field spider's loom.⁷’ H. More.

 

Even Dr. Hooke advances a conjecture that the great white clouds seen in summer might
consist of gossamer. Microgr. 202. Dr. Hulse and Μαι-1111 1115181· first observed the real
mode of its production by 8 species of spider. See Ray's Letters, 36, G9; Lister de
Araneis3 and the interesting relation in White's Hist. Selb. The etymology of the word
is very obseure3 Skinner suggests yossampine, Fr. yossipium, Lat. the cotton plant. The
derivation proposed in the Craven Glossary, from its appellation “ summer-gasse, hence
gauze θ’ 111’ summer, gauzamer, alias gossamer,'' 15 hardly tenahle, when it is considered
that the term was probably received in our language long before the introduction of the
tissue called gauze. An early instance of its occurrence is in the gloss on G. de Bibeles-
worth, whose treatise was composed in the time of Edw. Ι.

“Reqardet cy lafilazmclre (gosesomer.)’' Arund. MS. 220, f. 301.

“Filiandra, Anylice, gossomer.'' Lat. Eng. Vocab. Harl. MS. 1002. “Gossommer,
thynges that flye in sommar lyke copwebbes.'' PALSG. ‘⁶ CouvraiHes, gossymeare, or
the white and cobweb-like exhalations which flye abroad in hot sunnie weather.’⁷ co'rG.
In N. Brit. according to Jamieson, it 15 called also sun-dew webs, or moosewebs. In
German, unser Fraweu Haar, the Blessed Virgin's hair. See Jamieson, v. Garsummer3
and Nares.
