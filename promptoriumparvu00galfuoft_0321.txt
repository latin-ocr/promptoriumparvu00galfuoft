In the Avowynge of Kyng Arther, a “ gunne '⁵ is mentioned, the effect of which is coni-
pared to lightning, but it is still doubtful whether the term should be understood to
imply a projectile impelled by any ignited substance, or merely filled therewith.

“ There came fliand a gunne,
And lemet as the leuyn.” St. 65, edit. by Mr. Robson.

It seems very probable that the missile here intended was a tube filled with Greek fire,
or fea volam. In several MSS. of the Practica of John Arderne, a surgeon of eminence
t. Edw. ΙΙΙ. instructions are found for compounding “fewes Greyoc's ” and “foeces τυίιιιιῐε ;''
the latter being a liquid mixture, described as of an oily nature, with which a pipe being
filled, and ignited by a match, would fly in any direction. A figure is given in the
margin. He proceeds to describe “fewe volant '' of another kind. ‘⁴ Peraea j. li. (le

I'em (appelle gonne.'’ Sec Sloane MSS. 335, 795. A detailed account of passages in
ancient documents or chronicles which throw light on this obscure subject has bccn
given by Sir S. Meyrick, in his Crit. Enquiry‚ and a papcr on the history of hand fire-
arms, Archaeol. xxii.; and likewise by Mr. Arehibald‚ in his description of ancient
artillery discovered on the coast of Lancashire‚ Archaeol. xxiiii. It may here suffice
to state that gunpowder was known in NVestern Europe about the middle of the XlIIth
cent. 3 and that the earliest recorded instance of its use in war, in this country„ appears
to have been in the first expedition of Edward ΠΙ. against the Seots,i11 1327, when
artillery, termed by Barbour ‘⁶ crakys of wer,'' was employed. See Jamieson. There can
be no doubt that Chaucer uses the term “gonne‚'’ to signify an engine charged with
gunpowder3 as in the following comparison:

‘⁸ Swift as a pellet out of a gonne,
'When fire is in the pouder ronne.'' House of Fame, B. iii.

The Household of Edw. III. as appears by the ordinances which commen-:e 1344, printed
by the Ant. Soc.‚ comprised “ Ingyners lvij. Artellers vj. Gonners vj.” Their daily pay in
time of war was 6<l. The invention of hand fire-arms is assigned by Sir S. Meyrick‚ on
the authority of Billins, to the Lucquese, in 1430; (Archaeol. xxii. 60) yet a prior use of
some weapons of the sort seems to be indicated. In an Inventory of the arms and effects
of Sir Simon Burley, taken apparently after his execution, 1388, and now in the posses-
sion of Sir Thomas Phillipps, among “petites choses ὰ Baynard Castell,'' is nazned ‘'j-
pelz't gonne de feer.'' In the Pell Records, 1 Hen. IV. 1400, payments appear for
“quarell gunnes,” at Ts. each; for saltpetre, sulphur, and wadding; and the contem-
porary evidence of Monstrelet shews that ‘⁴ hasloas ὰ feu ⁷’ were among the arms of the
English sent to the relief of the siege of Orleans, in 1428. Hand-gans are named among
purchases for the defence of Holy Island, 14463 and were used at the siege of Caistor,
in Norsolk, about 1459. Paston Lett. iv. 316. In the version of Vegecius attributed to
Trevisa, and completed 1408, in the account οἳ military engines, allusion is made to
“ gretc gonnes that shete now a daies stones of so grcte peyse that no walle may with-
stonde thcm; as bathe bc welc shewede nothe in tho Northe cuntrc, and cke in the
