¹ The Latin-English Vocabulary‚ Harl. MS. 1587, gives “szzomnitas, coppe‚''
namely, of a steeple. In the Wieliffite version, Luke iv. 29 is thus rendered, “And
they ledden him to the coppe of the hil, on which her cytee was bildid, to cast him
down.’' The erest on a bird's head likewise was thus termed, “Cop, cerras, crista,
ese aviam ut yalli vel alaude.” cam. ANG. The gloss on Gautier de Bibelesworth ex-
plains “yelz'ne Ιιῑιρέε, coppede hen;'’ and Elyot gives “Stymphalide a coppe of
sethei-s, whiche standeth on the head ofa byrde.'' In Norfolk‚ the term copple-crowu
still has this meaning. Horman says, “ Somtyme men were coppid cappis like a sugar-
lofe,'' and uses the term “a cop—heedyd felowe= cilo,'’ which is explained by Elyot as
having a great round forehead ; and again, ⁴⁸ Homer, declaryng a very folysshe and an
haskard felowe under the person of Thersyte, sayth that he was copheeded lyke a gygge,
vertice acuminato.” Cotgrave rendere “ piynon, a finiall, cop, or small pinnacle 011 the
ridge of a house.''' The epithet is applied to the pointed shoe, or poleyn, in fashion
in the XVth century. “Milleus, a copped shoo.'' ORTUS. Ang. sax. cop, apex.

² See above CAPPE, capa. This sacred vestment commonly called a cope, the wearing
of which has fallen into disuse, excepting at coronations, is by the Canons of the Re—
formed Church directed to be worn at the celebration of the communion in cathedra!
and collegiate churches. See Queen Elizabeth's AdvertisementS‚ A.D. 1564‚W11kins'
Conc. lv. p. 248,and the Ecclesiastical Constitutions, οι· Canons, A.D. 1604, ibid.

³ The Catholicon explains capitellum as signifying merely the capital of a column,
but in the Medulla it is rendered ‘⁴ summa pars copistsst' and in this sense, coporne
signil'ying the apex or pinnacle‚ the work with which a tower‚ or any ornamental con-
struction, is crowned, may perhaps be regarded as a diminutive of coppe. The term
occurs in a curious description of a caede, written about the time of Richard. 11.
