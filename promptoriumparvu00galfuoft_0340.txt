c. F. repoficilz‘um.” Tho word intended may be reirofocz'nium‚ or reposocinz'um. See
Ducange. 'she Catholicon gives the following explanation z “Repojbcilz'u1n‚ id quod τερ-ἐι
iyaenz iu. nocte, vel quod 'retro z'ynem punitum· super quod a βοείῃ-ἰωή partesoci liqna
ponuntur, quod mlgso lm· ‹liciturJ' In Harl. MS. 1738, it is rendered ‘⁴ an herthe stok,
or a skreue3’' in the Ortus, “a buddo ox· a sterne.” A stoek (Ang.-Sax. stoc, truncus)
may signify priinarily a large log, against which, as a foundation, the fire was piled. The
cellarist of St. Edmund's-bury held Hardwick under the abbey, and was bound annually
to provide “ iv, Cristmesse stoeke‚'' each of ὃ feet in length. Liber Celler. Rokewode's
Suff. p. 475. Hence, probably, any contrivance whereby the fire was supported, so as to
facilitate combustion5 an object more perfeotly attained by means of andirons (AWNDERNE‚
snpra), was termed the heau-th-stock. In Norfolk and Suffolk the back 01· sides of the
fire-plaee are termed “ the stoek,'' and Forby derives the word from Ang.-Sax. stoc, locus.
See KYNLYFJ hereafter.

¹ A hank of yarn is called in the North a hesp, or hasp. the fourth part of a spindle.
Bp. Kennett gives ¹‘ a hank of μη] or thread, when it comes off the reel, and is tied in
the middle, or twisted. So the twist οι· rope that comes over ye saddle of the thiller horse
is called the thille hauks3 Dnnselm. Perhaps from Sax. hangan, to tie or twist; but it
comes much nearer to the Isl. haunk, fmzc'ffllus ίη cia-culmi colle'9‹clzts.'’ Lansd. MS.
1033. fllutaxa signifies the oomb which serves for dressing flax, as given above under the
word animm-2, but implies also a hank of spun thread. See Ducange.

² ‘⁴ Pffiscuam, a lytol Iok of tre, a haspe, a cospe. a sclott.‘' MED. MS. CANT. “ Pessulum
<licitur sera lissum ‘luni hostium pellilar cam seratur, Anylz'ce a lytoke, or latche.or a snecke,
οι· barre ot· a dore.'⁸ ORT. “ Haspe of a dore, clz'clmtess' PALSG. “Agymplza a elaspe,
hook, brace. grapple, haspe.'’ COTG. In this last sense the word haspa occurs in the Sher-
born Cartulary, MS. in the posseszion of Sir Thomas phillipps, where, among the gifts of
’william the saei-ist <X11t11eent.÷) is mentioned “Jsissale cum lca-522& ‹wycnteo‘iss’ Bp.
Kennett observes that in Kent, Susex, and Oxfordshire, the word is pronounced “haps‚
to hnps a door or cuphoard. Augu-Sax. haeps, sera, silualfess’ Lansd. MS. 10:323. This older
form is also retained in Souna-set, Wilts, and in N. Britain, hasp being the corruption.
See Jamieson.
