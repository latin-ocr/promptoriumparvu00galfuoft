appears by the inventories of the treasuries at Old St. Paul's and Lineoln, printed by
Dugdale. It must be observed that some distinction seems to have been made in Italy

¹ To fare, Aug-Saxi. faran, ire, is a verb frequently used by the earlier writers, as
R. Brunne, Rob. of Gloueester, Langtoft‚ and Chaueer.

fare with one, or entreate hym well or yuell. I fare, I playe at a game so named at the

is fasylled. ravelde. Fasyll of elothe, cas-wrcff’ p Ange-Saxi. faesffl‘ndmu'a. The term to
ravel, now generally used 111 this sense, thus appears to be derived, not from the verb
to reave, or tear away, as it 11115 been supposed, but from tho Freneh.
