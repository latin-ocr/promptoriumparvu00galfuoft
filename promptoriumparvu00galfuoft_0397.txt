2 Pedium is explained in the catholicon and Ortus to be “ baculus super quem innitimur,
cnm (luo sepe terram fermus, a lene.'' Ducange cites the Usus Ord. Cisterc. c. 68, where
by this term is implied “ pars formoe mmmcclcicae, cui monachi, cum procumbunt, inni-
tantur? audit seems possible that allusion is here made by Friar Geoffrey to the staff
which, according to the usage in some establishments. served to give an occasional
support during the long services of the cheir, an object which was more usually attained
by means of the misericorde, orfimmelloe. In some of the German churches the use of
the leaning staff is still retained, and a remarkable specimen, apparently of German
workmanship, now preserved in the De Bruges collection at Paris, was intended, as
Lenoir supposed, to answer this purpose. The curious character of its ornaments indicates
its having been fashioned sor some sacred use, and the lion statam, by which it is sur-
mounted, gives it, in some measure, the form of the Tau staff, as it has been termed.

³ Leme, a shining light, Ang.-Sax. leonia, jubar, is a word not uncommonly used by
the old writers; see R. Gloue. p. 1863 Vision of Piers P. 12‚324; Cant. Tales, 14,836.
“ Fulyzcs, lemynge bat touchethe. cmlyzcr,lemy11ge bat brennethe. Cscsma, brennynge
of the leeme of the fyre.'' MED. MS. CANT. [n the Aha-aviam Chronica printed by the
Camb. Antiqu. Soc. from the MS. at Caius Coll. it is recorded, A.D. 1402, “Icoc (mozo
apparuit stella comata, Anylz'ce vocata lemyng sterr, prognosticans Bellum filiarum, vicl.
bellam Szclopz'd’ Fabyan relates that in 7 Will. Rufus “ grysly and vncouth syghtes
were sene, as hostes of men fightyn in γε skye, and fyre lemys and other.” Compare
GLEMYNGE, or lemynge of lyghte, p. 198. See also hereafter STEEM, or lowe of fyre, and
STEMYNGE, or lemynge of fyyr. Bp. Kennett notices leam as signifying a flash or blaze of
fire, in Durham ; Lansd. MS. 1033; and Brockett gives leam, as retained in the Northern
Dialect.

⁴ Junius derives this term from Ang.-Sax. leof, dilectus, and man, denoting the
human species generally, without distinction of sex. Hickes in his A.-S. grammar gives
leue-mon, amasius, Norm.-Sax.; by R. Glouc. the word is written lefm0n‚ p. 3443
and in the lVinchester MS. of the Promptorium leefman' is given as synonymous with
SPECYAI„ concubyne, the man. The editor of the Towneley Mysteries would deduce an
argument for the antiquity of that work from the fact that lemman occurs therein solely
in the primary and simple sense of a person beloved. It is thus used also by R. Brunne,
p. 2363 but it more commonly denotes one loved illieitly, or with mere gallantry, as
the word is used by Chauccr and Gower, and applied to either sex. “ Bassaris, a mylche
cowe. or a prestys lennnande.'' Vocab. Harl. MS. 1002. ‘¹ A leman, amasius, amasia,
concubina,focaria, pele:c; pelifsnns, pelc'yna, filius vel fllia ejus ; ηιαῖίῑόαἷια, multiyamus,

parate (emat, a lemman, or a louer. Amasin, i. mulier qui (ιιιιαί sine leffe, a lemman.
