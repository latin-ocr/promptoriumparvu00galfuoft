APPENDIX. lvii

The text in this editio princeps varies considerably from that of the later
editions which Ι have scen. In some instances, errors of the press seem to
have been corrected3 in others, the earlier edition is more accurate than the
later, and a large number of hexameter lines illustrating the meaning of
Latin words, here introduced with the heading “ Versus‚'⁷ are not found in
subsequent editions3 these reprints do not appear in other respects to have
undergone any material abridgment.

The edition printed by Pynson in 1509, is not less rare than that of
1500 by W. de Worde. The following descn'ption has been taken from a
copy in the King's Library in the British Museum. It was in Herbert's
collection in 1773. It is a small 4t0. measuring 7} by 5; Sign. 3 iii.
is wanting. Fo. 1. Title partly printed in red.

never to have seen the edition of 1500 (in perfect state), supposed that this book had
been printed by W. de WVorde about the close of the fifteenth century, and that it
might be the editio princeps of the Ortus, ranging with Pynson’s folio Promptorium. In
its present state this copy consists of 264 leaves, measuring 10 inches by 73- inches; it com-
mences with Sign. A. ii.-“ A est nomen prime littere,'' and ends, “ Zintala,...i. parva
musca, culeX, f. p.‚'' on the leaf following Sign. QQ. iiii. Dibdin recognised the type
as the earliest used by W. de Worde and discontinued about 1510. This book was
presumed to be unique.
