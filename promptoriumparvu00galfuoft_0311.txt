¹ The term GRECE seems to be derived from the plural of gre, astop. It is thus
used in the Wicliffite version ; “ hou schalt not stye bi grees (per gradus, Vulg) to myn
auter, lest bi filbe be schewid.'' Exod. xx. 26. “ Forsolae Esdras be writere stood on
be grees of tree (super gundum Iiyneum, Vulg.) whiche he hadde maad to spoke beron.”
Esdras, viii. 4. Compare iv Kings, xxiii. 3, and Dedis‚ xxi. 35. Sir John Maundevile
says, in his relation of the state of the great Chan of Chatay, “the grees that he gothe
up to the table ben of precyous stones, medled with gold.” p. 259. And again, ‘⁶ Ves-
selle of sylver is there non, for thei telle no prys there of, to make no vesselle offe. but
thei maken ther of grecynges, and pileres‚and pawmentes to halles and chambres.” p.
263. In the version of Vegecius, which is attributed to Trevisa, among directions how
a strong place should be fortified by double walls, the intervening space being filled with
earth, it is said that there should be in the making of the inner walle. at euery fourty
or fifty fote of lengthe, esy gresinges fro the playn grounde of the citie up to the walls.”
Roy. MS. 18 A. XII. f. 100. “ Gradus, a grece, a steppe. Grodo, to leede, or greys.''
MED. ms. cnr. “A grece, 9radus; yraclare, i. yradas facere, vel per yradus ducere.''
cATH. ANG. “ Coclea, turnegrece.'' Lat. Eng. Vocab. Roy. MS. 17 C. XVII. “Scamnum,
a steppe or grice‚ whereby a manne gothe vppe into a hygh bedde. Anabatha-um. a
pulpit or other lyke place, whiche standeth on hyghe, wherunto a man must go vp by
a ladder or grises.” ELYOT. “ Grece to go vp at, or a stayre, (leyre'ff' PALSG. ¹⁶ Deme,
a staire, step, greese.'' co'rG. See Forby's observations on the word grissens, which still
signifies stairs in Norfolk3 Craven Glossary‚ v. Grees 3 and Nares.

² This name of the badger, which was taken, probably, from its colour, has previously
occurred as synonymous with BAWSTONE. The gloss on the Equivoca of John de Gar-
landia gives the following explanation : ‘¹ Taxus, quoddam animal, a brocke or a grey.''
‘⁵ Graye, a beest, taxe.'‘ PALSG. “Graearcss a badger, boason‚ brocke, or gray.'' COTG.
‘¹ Graio, a gray, a brocke, a badger.” FLORIO. See Holland’s Pliny, viii. c. 38.

³ Croppe or corne, MS. “Annona est selles unius (mni, corne of one yere.'' ORTUS.

⁴ ‘⁹ Grayns, mustellam, quoddam species εἱς-Μ’ carn. ANG. The aromatic qualities
of cardamoms‚ and grains of Paradise, were anciently much esteemed. Chaucer says of
the amorous Absolon, when he prepares to court the carpenter's wife,

“ But first he cheweth grein and licorise‚
To smellen sote, or he had spoke with here.’' Miller's Tale.

They are again mentioned in Rom. of the Rose. Gerarde and Parkinson give represen-
tations of the Illeliquetle‚ greatest sort of cardamom5‚ G'rzzna Par-adigi, or Guinea grains ;
a pod shaped like a fig, and full of red seed. The true grains of Paradise were brought
