PREFACE. xxiii

(Ortus, first edition, by W. de Worde, 1500.) “ Qui flat in cinere vel qui
preparat pulverem muliebrem, Anglice a fyre blower, or an yren hoter.”
(Ortus, edit. 1509.)

At the close of this Preface will be found a list of MSS. of the Medulla
Grammatice and of other Latin-English Dictionaries of the fifteenth cen-
tury, which probably may be classed therewith. An account of the
various editions of the Ortus Vocabulorum is there also given.

ΙΙ. Ι proceed to offer some remarks on the sources from which the Latin
words in the Promptorium were derived, according to the list given by the
compiler. See p. 3, insi-a.

1. The first of the “ auctores, ex quorum libris collecta sunt vocabula
hujus libelli,'’ is the most ample and highly esteemed of mediaeval diction·

texturis elaboratum atque contextum‚'’ as stated in a colophon from which
we learn that his labors were completed in the year 12863ι However
severely this great work and also the treatises by John de Garlandia and
other such writers are decried by Erasmus, in his lamentations regarding the
degraded character of rudimental education at the commencement of the
sixteenth century, the student of mediaeval antiquities or of the‘fiterature
of the period will find in the Catholicon an auxiliary rarely to be con-
sulted without advantage and instruction.

2. Uguitio, Ugutio, or Hugo, a native of Pisa, was Bishop of Ferrara
towards the close of the twelfth century. Ughelli supposes that he died
about 1212.1> The Elementarz'um compiled about A.D. 1053 by Papias
