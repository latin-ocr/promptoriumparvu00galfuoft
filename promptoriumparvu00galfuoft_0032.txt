xxiv PREFAOE.

ponere statuimus, in quo, prae aliis, vocabulorum significationes, significa-
tionum distinctiones, derivationum origines, etymologiarum assignationes,
et interpretationum reperientur expositiones, quorum ignorantia Latinitas
naturaliter indiga quadam doctorum pigritia non modicum coarctatur.'’
Numerous MSS. of the Vocabularz‘um of Uguitio exist, but it does not
appear that it was ever p1*inted.³ It will be noticed that the compiler of
the Promptorium cites not only the work in maj0ri volumine, but also one in
a metrical form designated Uyuz'tio versificath

3. Brito—The treatise by William Brito, to which frequent refer-
ence is made by the compiler of the Promptorium, is probably his “ Summa,
sive opusculum difficilium vocabulorum* Biblie,'’ an explanatory Glossary
of words occurring in Holy Wrst, sometimes entitled “ Lexicon sive Voca-
bularium Biblie,'' or, as described by Fabricius, “ Vocabularius cum
vocabulorum Hebraicorum in Bibliis occurrentium interpretatione Latina.”
Some account of this work may be found in Du Cange's Preface to his
*Glossaryu ξ 49, edit. Henschel, t. i. p. 30, and Bandinius, Codd. Lat. t. iv.

col. 213. The Summa is in prose, but it commences with some prefatory
verses :—

Difficiles studeo partes, quas Biblia gestat,

Pandere ; sed nequeo latebras nisi qui manifestat

Auxiliante Deo, &c.

ὃ The following MSS. may be enumerated. In the Bodleian, Laud MS. 1334, 71,
“ Huicii Pisani Dictionarium Latinum ;” and MS. Bodleii, 2486, 9. “ Huguitionis Pisani
Derivationes magnae sive Dictionarium Etymologicum;” Cat. MSS. Angl. t. i. pp. 70, 129:
“ Hugonis, vel Hugutionis, episcopi Pisani derivationes magnae,” δια, Lambeth MS. 80:
‘¹ Hugonis liber de significatione verborum, sive derivationes magnae, opus valde prolixum‚”
ibid. No. 120. See also Arundel MSS. in Brit. Mus. 127, 508, and 515, the latter being an
abridgement. MSS. are also to be found in the Cathedral libraries at York and Durham3 at
Balliol College, Nos. 279, 298, and at Caius College‚ No. 459; Catal. by the Rev. J. J.
Smith. In Add. MS. 1161] may be found “Tabula per alphabetum condita a fratre
Lamberto de Pisis? an index of all words explained by Uguitio, with the indication
of the primary words under which they occur, facilitating the use of the work.

t> Possibly to be found in the Lambeth Library, MS. No. 502, f. 15, “ Regulae gram-

maticales versibus conelusae.'' In some instances reference is made in the Promptorium

both to the work “ ia majori 2·0l21.mz'ne,'' and also in the versified form. It deserves notice,
that, where the latter is cited, the reference is rarely to the letter which is the initial of
the Latin word in question. Thus we find “Cleppyn or clench5n3 tz'7zm‘o; Ug. V. in S.—

Heere bonde; ema,- Ug. V. in C.—-Mete yevare; (lupatio-usa· Ug. V. in A.—Mychare; erro,-
Ug. V. in Ρ.” etc.
