drinke wyll pall (s'czppallyra) if it stande vncouered all nyght. Ι palle, Ι fade of freshe-
nesse in colour or beautye, ieflaz'tris.” PALSG. In the Customs of London, Arnold's
Chron. p. 85, are given articles desired by the commons of the city, such as that the
Mayor and council should enact that all barrels of ale and beer be filled quite full,
“after thei be leyde on the gyest3 for by reason that the vessels haue not been full
afore tyme, the occupiers haue had gret losse, and also the ale and byere haue palled‚
and were nought. by cause such ale and biere hathe taken wynde in spurgyng.'’ In
the version of Beza's Sum of the Christian Faith, by R. Fyll, Lond. 1572, f. 1:34, it is
observed of the usage of the Church of Rome, “It is meruaile that they doe not
reserue—-the wine as well as the breade, for the one is as precious as the other. It
were out of order to saye they feare the wine will eger, or waxe palled, for they hold
that it is no more wine.'’

¹ Itis worthy of remark that Boltlzeus, which usually denotes a belt, or arming-
girdle‚ seems to be taken in the Promptorium in the sense of 3 close-fitting or closely
girt garment, such as was used first under armour of mail, or of plate, to bear off the
weight, and preserve the skin from being chased, and subsequently in the place of
armour. Compare COTE ARMURE, p. 95; DOBBELET, p. 12⁷4; and IAKKE of defence,
p. 256; all of these being rendered Baltlzeus. Sir Roget de Norwico bequeaths, in
1370, “ unum paltoke de veluete cum armis meis‚· unumpar cle plati-5, coopertum cum
rubeo veluet,'' διο. Harl. MS. 10 3 Transcripts from Norwich Registers. Mention occurs
of the ‘⁴ paltok,” in Vision of Piers P. v. 12‚1QQ ; 14,36⁶2 ; in both passages as a gar-
ment of defence. camden, in his Remains, in the chapter on apparel, cites a history
called Eulogium, which seems to have been written about A.D. 1400, and mentions,
amongst extravagant fashions used by the commons, “ a weed of silk which they call a
Paltocke: their hose are of two colours, or pied with more, which, with lachets which
they call Herlots‚ they tie to their Paltocks without any b1·eeches.'’ Here the term
apparently does not designate a military garment. The Ordinance of Peter, Duke of
Brittany, to 0311 the nobles and archers to arms in 1450, directs that “ les nobles tenant
αιι dessous de lx. li. (Ie rente aient briyandines-—oa ὰ tout le moins bons paletocques‚
orme: de nom-ellesapom sans manc-llos, ἷι laiselzes (Ie fer, ου, mames Sur· le bras.'’
Monstrelet states that the town of Neelle surrendered to the Comte de Charrolois, A.D.
1464, on condition that the men-at-arms should be at liberty to depart with their
harness, “et les archim-s s'en iroient en leurs pourpoints, ou paleira, chacun une ver-
yette en Sa mai7z.’‘ Chron. iii. c. 112. The term seems here to denote a military defence
of an inferior description. According to Roquefort the paletot was a kind ofpourpoint,
or a sort of military cloak, so called from palla, or as Borel suggests, from pelium.

thick Pelt, or cassock; 3 garment like a short cloak. with sleeves; or such a one as
most of our modern Pages are attired in.’' coro. Spanish, ‘⁴ Paletoque, a jerkin with
short skirts.'' Mffisnssu. Skelton uses this term to denote a patch‚ as given by Pals-
grave, or some kind of head-gear, in a Poem against Master Garnesche, addressing him
thus: ⁸⁴ ΥΡ. cappyd Cayface copious. your paltoke on your pate.'' Ed. Dyce, i. p. 118.
