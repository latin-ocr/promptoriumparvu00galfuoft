XXXVI PREFACE.

by Mr. Mayer.⁸ Boetius is cited in the Winchester MS. under “ Sokynge
Grownde,’' p. 463. The work may have been his treatise ‘⁶ De Consola-
tione Philosophica‚’' or that “De disciplina scolarium.” Fabr. Bibl. Lat.
The import of the reference occurring as follows has been sought in vain.—
“Damasyn‚ frute3 coquinella, secundum Levasey 3⁹⁹ p. 1133 the citation of
that authority here occurs only in the YVinchester M S. “Hummynge3 reuma,
secundum Levsay,'’ p. 2533 “Knast or gnaste of a kandel3 emunctam, se-
cundum Levsay‚” p. 277.b I have been unsuccessful also in identifying the
author cited as Ricardus under the words “ Cyndyr,'' p. 78, and ‘⁴ Wylke‚”
p. 5283 or the signification of the following reference found in the Win-
chester MS. only; “ Sete for worthy menn3 orcestra, vel orcisti-a, secundum
cod& (or cundys P).

It may deserve notice that Galfridus gives, as English words, ⁴⁴ Caton‚''
doubtless the Disticha attributed to Dionysius Cato, “ F aceet‚⁷’ a popular
supplement to that work, and ‘³ Donet‚’' the grammar most in use in the
middle ages, composed by AElius Donatus in the fourth century. See the
notes, s. v.‚ pp. 63, 127. We find also several service-books, Antiphoner,
Gran, Missal, “ Poortos‚’' namely the portisorium or breviary for a priest, (ἑο.

The following word may not be undeserving of notice: “ Seventene,
septem deceni, vel decem et septem secundum correcciones fratrum pre-
dicatorum‚'' or, according to the reading of another MS. “ Cevyntene,
secundum nostram correccionem septem et decem.'' In this passage it is
not quite clear what may be the meaning of the word correccio, whether
the rule (disciplina) of the Order, or some emendation of the original MS.
of the Promptorium remaining in the possession of the friars. The copies
prove on collation to present numerous variations not merely in spelling,
but in regard to words both English and Latin added or omitted, and
moreover certain words are supplied by the text printed by Pynson which I
have not found in any MS.

III. Ι will now enumerate the MSS. and editions of the work.

1. The MS. which has been selected as the Text of the present edition
is the Harleian MS. No. 221. It is a small quarto of 205 leaves of parch-

b See also “Schryvyn 01· here scr-yssym audire confessiones, nichil aliud inveni per

grammaticam;'’ to which in the Winchester MS. is added, “scapulagito, secundum
Levsay.'' The like reference occurs under “ Trunchon, wyrme.'¹
