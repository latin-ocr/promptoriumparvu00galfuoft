Aug. Sax. drof, sordidus. Matt. Paris has given a charter of Guarin, Abbot of St.

grains that remain after brewing, called in French drasclze, οι· drayue. Compare

¹ N umerous virtues are ascribed by Macer and other writers to the herb dragaunce or
nedder's tongue, called also dragon wort, addyrwort, or serpentine, arum or aron. See
Roy. MS. 18 Α. VI. f. 73. Macer says that “water of dragaunce ys gode to wasshe

“ Sow barly and dredge with a plentiful hand.''
“Thy dredge and thy barlie goe thresh out to malt.”

Bp. Kennett‚ in his glossarial oolleetions, Lansd. MS. 1033, mentions “ dredge maust,
malt made of oats mixed with barley malt, of which they make an excellent fresh quick
sort of drink,'’ used in Staffordshire. “Drczyea (msc chetaeos, provender of divers sorts
