¹ Harinyya seems here to be given for harenya, or arenya, a public declamation. See
Ducange. Randon, in its primary signification, appears to be synonymous with the old
Fr. randon, violence, impetuous speed‚ a sudden shock. Thus Sir John Maundevile
relates that, on solemn festivals, at the Court of the Chan, ‘⁴ thei maken knyghtes to
jousten in armes fulle lustyly, and thei rennen to gidre a gret randoum, and thei
frusschen to gidere fully fiercely.’' p. 286. Holinshed describes the onslaught upon
the Duke of Somerset at the battle of Tewkesbury, “ with full randon,’' as made by
certain spear-men placed by Edward IV. in ambush. ‘⁵ Aller ὰ la yrand ramlon, to
go very fast. Randonner, to run violently.’' co‘rG. Elyot gives *¹ Dee-ursio, iustes as
at the tilte or randon.” In a secondary sense this word seems t0 have implied an
array or line of combatants‚ or a continuous flow of words, as in an harangue.

'2 chancer uses this word both as a substantive and an adverb. In the Vision of
P. Ploughman the verb to rape, to hasten, occurs, as also the adverbs rapely and
ra elier.

g “Flebat-ula, lytelle folke or raskalle. Plebs, folk or raskalle.” MED. Fabyan,
under the year 1456, speaks of ‘⁴ a multitude of rascall and poore people of the cytye.'‘
certain animals, not accounted as beasts of chace, were likewise so termed. In the St.
Alban's Book it is stated that ¹⁴ there be fiue beasts which we cal beasts of chace, the
buke, the doe, the foxe, the marterne, aud the roe; au other of what kinde soeuer terme
them Rasca11.” It appears, however, from the Mayster of Game, that the hart, until he
was six years old, was accounted “rascayle or t'oly.'’ Vesp. B. xm, f. 25. In the
Survey of the Estates of Glastonbury Abbey‚ taken at the Dissolution‚ the deer in the
various parks are distinguished as ‘⁴ deere of anntler’' and “ deere of Rascall.‘’ Hearue’s
P. Langt. ii. 345. Horman says, ‘⁶ He hath bought rascals and other shepe, reiut-ula&

emit et promiscuas ove3.—This is but rochel and rascall wine, lortiuum vinum.’' In the
Household Ordinanees of Henry VIII. A.D. 1526, some kind of fish is thus termed,
