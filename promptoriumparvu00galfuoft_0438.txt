Which stelth is hote, and micherie
With hym is euer in company.”

It signifies also one who commits any sneaking, mean, or miserly act : and, according
to Nares, a truant. Horman says, “ He strake hym through the syde with a dager,

3 Chaucer uses the term mitehe, R. of Rose, 5585, where it is explained by Tyrwhitt
as siguifying a manchet, a loaf of fine bread. The old French word miche, and Latin
mica, or mic-hia, signify, according to Roquefort and Ducange‚ a small loaf. “alica
ponitur pro pom> modico qni fit in curiis maynatorum vel in monosteriis.'’ cA'rH.
Hearne gives in the notes to the Liber Niger, p. 654, a quotation from the Register of
Oseney, 552 Hen. III, wherein mention occurs of maynce michioe, of the bis-a and sala
wichim and Spelman cites a document which describes ‘⁴ albos pane-r, vocatos michis.’'
In 1:351 Robert‚ Abbot of Liueshau, granted ‘¹ viij. maynas micas majoris ponderis de
pane com-entus· ” to Adam de Kaukbury; and a corrody is enregistered in the Leiger
