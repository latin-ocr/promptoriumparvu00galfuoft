¹ In the will of the Earl of Essex, 1361, occur bequests “ ὰ Mestre Thomas le serour,
v. marcs; ὰ un yarson pur Ie femur, xxs.,· ὰ un [sav-son semer, i. marc.” Royal
Wills, p. 50. Elyot renders “veterinarius medicus, a horseleche, or ferror,'' now
called corruptedly a farrier. In the version of Pliny, by Holland, it is related that the
Empress Poppaea “was knowne to cause her ferrers ordinarily to shoe her coach
horses, and other palfries, διο. with cleane gold.’' B. xxxiij. c. 11. 111 the order of the
Pageants of the Play of Corpus Christi, at York, 1415, are enumerated among the
various trades, “smythes, fevers.” Sharpe’s Coventry Mysteries‚ p. 137. This last.
appellation is taken directly from the old French‚ ferre, seht-re, or serre, a black-
smith.

² Among the appliances of a sacred nature, there were feretra of two kinds; first,
the bier for carrying the cot-pse to the grave, “ feretrum, baere‚’' Gloss. AElfric.‚ thus
mentioned in the laws of Henry 1., “amici extrahant mortuum, deferentes in sere-
trum, et portantes eum ad ecclesiamf’ By the Constitutions of Will. de Bleys,
1229, and Walter de Cantifflpe, 1240, Bishops of Womester, as also of Abp.
Peckham, 1280, among the ornaments and requisites to be provided in every church, at
the charge of the parishioners, was included “feretrum competens ad sepulturam mor-
tuO7·u7n.” Wilkins, i. 623, 666; ii. 49. In its secondary sense feretrum signified a
portable shrine. containing the relies of saints, and carried in processions on a frame
similar to the ordinary bier ; and also stationary shrines of similar fashion, but which it
was not customary to display as gestatory ornaments, such as those of St. Cuthbert at
Durham. or St. Thomas of Hereford, in the cathedral there. It is recorded in Reg.
Roff. 120, that ‘¹ lVillz'elmus Rex Anylz'e maynus, in articulo mortis (1087) ‹ledit—-
feretrum, cum altari yestcctorio cleaoyentaco, et pallium cum leonibus.’' In 1355, Eliza-
beth de Clare, daughter of Gilbert Earl of Gloucester, made the following bequest:
“Je devise ὰ δείηι Thomas ele Hereford un ymaye de n're dame, d'arssent surm-re,
d'estre tache' sur son fiertre.’' Roy. Wills, p. 31. In the ancient documents relating
to the shrine of St. Cuthbert the term feretrum implies, as Mr. Raine πεῖθε, not the
shrine itseff, but the quadrangular space or oratory wherein it stood: the keeper had
the title of feretrarius. See Raine's Saint Cuthbert. Among-st numerous representations
of the-feretrum may be mentioned the procession of St. Alban’s shrine, in the MS. of M.
Paris, with drawings, supposed to be by his own hand, Cott. MS. Nero, D. 1. ; Strutt’s
Manners and Customs, i. pl. lxiv, One occasion on which it was customary to carry
the feretra in procession, was at the parochial perambulations in Rogation week, a full
account of which will be found in Brand's Popular Antiq. vol. i. Horman, in his
chapter of sacred matters, says, “ We two muste beare the feretrum (tensam {jesum-e)
aprocession in the gange dayes.'' The term “fertre '' occurs in Langtoft’s Chronicle ;
and in the Golden Legend mention is made of the “fyerte‚'' or shrine of St. Alphey,
f. 117, b. “Fici-te, fiet-cre, fieb-e: C'lztisse. reliquerim, brancard.⁹' ROQUEF. The term
feretrzmz in the MS. Ordinar. Ecc. Rotom. signifies the pyxis, wherein the consecrated
Eucharist is deposited.
