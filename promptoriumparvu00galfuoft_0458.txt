1 The night-jar, Caprimulyus Europaeus, Linn. is called in the North, according to
the Craven Glossary, the night-crow. ‘⁴ A nyghte ravene, cetuma, nictit-oram, noctua,
strioe.‘' CATH. Axe. ‘¹ Night crowe, cresserelle.” PALsG.

2 WYKYR, MS. nikyr, K. nykyr, Η. nykir, Ρ. Compare Mermaydyfi, p. 334.
A.-Sax. nicor‚ monstrum fluviatile. “ N1oeras, ’⁹ Beowulf, v. 838. Kilian gives
Teut. “necker, Daemon aquaticus, IVeptunus, e7z7zosz'yens.‘' The Deity of the Sea,
according to the Northern mythology, was called Neckur, a name which was taken,
as VVachter supposes, from nack, equus, and nack, cymba, equus fluviatilis. See
Keysler, Antiq. Sept. p. 262². Boucher's Gl. v. Auld-Nick3 and Sir F. Madden‘s
note on La3amon, 1322. Of ancient tales regarding the mermaid see Gesner, lib. iv.
Stowe gives in his Annals, A.D. 1187, a marvellous relation of a merman taken near
Orford Castle, Suffolk‚ and kept there many months by Barth. de Glanvile, as recorded
by Rad. de Coggeshale, Cott. MS. Vesp. D. x. f. 88. The subject of Christian
symbolism has been hitherto so neglected that no explanation has been suggested
with regard to the frequent occurrence of the mermaid among decorations of a sacred
character. It was likewise very frequently introduced, in medjeval times, in the designs
of embroidery‚ and ornaments of ordinary use.

3 The Latin term given here seems to denote that NYLE signifies something of no
weight or account3 it may possibly denote the light flying particles, or flue, of wool.
The white downy substance which arises when brass is exposed to strong beat is called
nill. “ Nill, the sparkles, or ashes that come of brass tried in the furnace, pompholyoe‚
tucia, nil album, nihili, ceris et cadmiae favilla.” GOULDM. ‘⁴ Nill, les eseaz'lles
d'airain.’‘ SHERW. Palsgrave gives only ‘⁴ nayle of woll,” without any French word.
Noils, according to Forby, signify, in Norfolk‚ coarse refuse looks of wool, fit for
making mops. The reading of the Harl. MS. 2274 is “nyle, or wulle;‘’ but the
reading of the Winch. MS. would induce the supposition that the word had quite a
different signification from that which has been suggested, and were derived from Aug.-
SaX. nill, non velle.

‘² “ Nemyll, cautus, etc. nbi wyse.'' CATH. ANG. It would appear that the sense in
which the word occurs in the Promptorium were handy and skilful in taking or nyming
anything. Compare the use of the adverb “ neemly ;'' Townl. Myst. p. 105. ΜΥ-
CHARE, a pilferer, is rendered capax, p. 336. “ Capax, i. assidue capiens, ofte
holdynge, or tokynge.” ORTUS. Palsgrave gives “nymble, delyuer, or quycke of
ones lymmes, souple. Nymble, quycke, deliure.‘’

⁵ This old word is still in use in the North, according to Brockett, signifying to take
up hastily, or steal privately. “To nim, accipere, furari, subducere, surriperess’
GOULDM· See Nares. Ang.-Sax. niman, capere. Compounded with the preposition
be, or by, it occurs frequently, as used by Chaueer, in the sense osbereaving. Douglas,
