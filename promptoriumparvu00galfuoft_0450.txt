1 The correct reading is here given, probably, by the other MSS. The term mull is
still retained in the Eastern counties, and in the North, and signifies, according to

Forby, soft breaking soil.

prefixed to the second ed. of Gesner, lib. iv. states that the fish called keling in the
North, and cod in the South, on the Westem coasts is termed melwel. Spelman states
that the mulvellus of the Northern seas is the green fish‚ called in the Book of Customs
at Lynn Regis melvel, and haddock, and in Lancashire milwyn. In the statute for the
regulation of prices of fish and poultry, as given in Strype's Stowe, mulvel is mentioned.

although preserved, 35 it would appear, in the surname Murchison.
