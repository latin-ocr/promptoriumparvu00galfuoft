¹ The crowde appears to have been a six-stringed instrument resembling a fiddle,
called in Wales cru-th, and in Scotland cruit. Fortunatus, Bishop of Poitiers‚ who
wrote at the close of the VIth century, enumerating the kinds of music peculiar to
different eountries, uses this expression, ‘⁶ Clu-octa Britanna placet.'’ carm. 111). vii.
c. 8. In the Wicliffite version, Judges xi. 34 is thus rendered, “Forsobe whanne
Iepte turnede a3en—his oon gendrid d0u3ter cam to him wil> tympans and croudis.'‘

The word occurs again, Luke xv. 25.

² Of the barrow, called in the Romance of Sir Amiloun a ‘⁴ croude wain,'' and still
called in the Eastern Counties a crud-barrow, some notice has been taken under the
word BAROWE. The use of the verb occurs in the following passage, after the descrip-
tion of the leprous knight being placed in the barrow‚

‘⁵ Then Amoraunt crud Sir Amiloun
Thureh mani a cuntre vp and down.'' Amis and Amiloun.

Moore gives the verb to crowd as signifying in Suffolk to push or shove.

³ This term, as well as several others of synonymous meaning. appear to be onoma-
topeias, and to be traced to their similarity of sound to the noise which they express.
The Medulla explains σοαπ to be “vox ranarum, croudynge of padoky5.'' Palsgrave
gives ‘⁴ to crowle, crouz'ller. My bely crowleth, I wene there be some padokes in it.”
Horman say5‚ “his bely maketh a great crowlynge‚ patitur botlwrgsymon.'' In N.
Britain to cmud, according to Ruddiman, signifies the noise of frogs. See Jamieson.
