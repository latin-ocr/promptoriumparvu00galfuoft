¹ Parkinson gives holm, 35 3 name of the holly: in the North it is called hollin. Aug.-
Sax. 1101011, aquifolium. The Gloss on Gautier de Bibelesworth renders “ Inous, holyn.”
‘⁶ Russus est quedam arhor que semper tenet viriditatem, Aszylic‘e‘ a 1101)’11.” ORTUS. ‘¹ An

Golden Legend, that after he became Abbot of Clairvaux, “he often made his pottage
with leues of 1101111.” Sherwood gives “hollie, holme, or huluer trec, lieux, lzousson,
mespllc'r sazlz·‹rye.'' In Norfolk the holl)v is called. hulver, according to Forby. Compare
HCLWUR, tre, liei-easter.

² “Bz‘tulassmm a place ber two sees rennen.” MED. In the Wicliffite version, Dedis
xxxii. 41 15 111115 rendered: ·‘ And wlian we fellen into 3 place of gravel gon al aboute
wil) be 500 (locum clitlmlassmn, Vulg.) bei hurtleden be ship.” Holm seems here to denote
the peninsula, or accumulatiou of alluvial deposit formed at 3 confluence ot‘ waters. It
15, however, remarkable that the 1131110 (1005 not appear to be thus applied on the Norfolk
coast, especially in the neighbourhood of Lynn, where 1110 Promptorium was compiled‚
and where such deposits are made to a vast extent by the 01150, and other streams that
flow into the Wash.

³ This name seems to be derived from Ang.-Sax hol, cavus, and riso, juncum but
35 the δεῖν-21115 lczcuslris, Linn. commonly called buli-rusb, has not 3 hollow but a Spongy
510111, the proper intention of the term is obscure.

holt, 311 apple-holt, Dumlm. 151. 1101110, ευίεὐγω.” Bp. Kcnnest, Lansd. MS. 1033.
§kinnor says that holt denotes a grove, or multitude οῖ’ trees planted thick together,
and Tooke asserts that it is the p. part of Ang.-Sax. helan, to cover, and signifies 3
rising ground or knoll covered with 11005. The word occurs in Cant. T. Prol. line 6 ;
Lydgate's Thebes; Launsal, «See. Among the benefactions of John Hotliam, Bp. Ely, it
15 recorded that in 1320 he appropriated‚ for the distribution of 311115 011 1115 3111111015313,
