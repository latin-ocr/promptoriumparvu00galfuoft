PREFACE. XXXV

of prestys‚’⁷ p. 413. The “ Vitae Patrum ”⁸ are given as the authority for
the Latin words occurring under “ Gylle, lytylle pot,'' p. 194. Reference
will be found to the ‘⁴ Horologium divine sapiencie '⁷ under ‘⁶ Amuce of an
hare,‘' p. 11, probably the treatise with that title by the celebrated Domi-
nican preacher and ascetic divine of the fourteenth century, Henry de
Suson; it was translated into French and English, and was printed by
Caxton. Pits, however, ascribes to John Wilton, a monk of Westminster‚
c. 1360, a treatise entitled ‘⁴ Horologium Sapientiae,’' commencing “ Sen-
tite de Domin0.” The name of an author whom Ι have not succeeded in
identifying occurs under “ Cawdelle3 caldellum,” p. 64, where it is said
“ hoc nomen habetiu· in commentario J ohannis de Gara.⁷‘ Under ‘⁴ F eest3
ayapes,'⁷ p. 158, are found the following, “N ota, de Agape in J ure, distinc-
tione xlij. Si quis ; et Raymundus, lib. iii. tit. iv.⁷’ The former of these is
a reference to the first part of the Decretum of Gratiam, of which several
printed editions exist3 the latter to the Summa by the Dominican Rai-
mundus de Pennaforte, compiler of the Decretals. Again, under another
word, “Frogge or froke, munkys abyte3 flocus, in Jure, libro vj.;” p. 179,
it is probable that we have a reference to the Decretals. References to
‘⁴ Greg' in dialog.’' deserve notice3 the work in question being probably the
Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, of which several early translations exist.
At p. 483 will be found “ Swerd berare3 spatarius, Greg' in dialog.⁷' and in
the Winchester MS. “ Schyppe, boote; carabus, secundum Greg' x. dialog.'’
Ι may also here notice the following: “Matyn at the obesse, mato, ij.
libro de tribus dietis, cap. ij.;'⁷b and “Matynge at the chesse; matacz'o,
in libro iij. de dominis, cap. ij.;’' p. 239. Under “Leterone'' we find a
Latin term for a lectern or desk, discus, given as “secundum li. equi,'' pos-
sibly, as has been already suggested, the metrical vocabulary entitled “Liber
Equus Caballus‚’⁷ given by Mr. Wright among the Vocabularies published

³ The ‘¹ De Vitis SS. Patrum liber '' has been attributed to St. Jernme, but hereon
the learned have been much at variance. Oudin, t. i. p. 851. The work was doubtless,
as Bellarmine and others have ohserved, compiled from several authors. These lives
have been frequently printed; they were translated into several languages. A translation
by Caxton from the French, finished, as the colophon states, on the last day of his life,
was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1495. Dibdin, Typog. Ant. vol. ii. p. 43.

¹³ Mr. W. S. Walford‚ to whose valuable suggestions I have very often been indebted,
has pointed out that among the books of Charles V. King of France, 1409, occurs a
“ Liber de tribus dietis‚‘' but there is no clue to what may have been the subject of it.
