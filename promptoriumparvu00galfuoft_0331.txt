hordeum) termed hasty from its being early, and coming to maturity in the third mouth
after it is sown. Gerarde refers the name Tm'mestre to the Amil-corn‚ or starch-corn,
Triticum amylenm, cultivated in Germany and the Low Countries to make starch3 but
according to Parkinson the grain here alluded to appears to be the naked barley‚ Hordeum
vernum, which, as he observes, “ is not scene or sowne by any almost in this land,'' called
in Germany Zeytgerste‚ or Titgerste, small barley, or “ one for the present.'’ It appears,
however, that in Tusser's time the early variety was cultivated in the Eastern eounties.

“ Sow barley in March, in April, and May,
The latter in sand, and the sooner in clay.’' March's husbandry.

¹ The enumeration of the household of Henry ΙΙ. 111 1118 constit. domus Regis, Liber
Niger Scacc. Hearne, i. 348, comprises ‘⁶ De massua coquina-hos? (esim-ius sl) lzastelariae‚”
his three men, and the “kusccclct7·ius.’' The latter seems to be the same as the ‘⁴ hastam-‚⁹⁹
named in the ordinance for the household 01 Louis XI. 1261, called in French lmsteur.
See Ducange. Humphrey de Bohun, Earl 01 Essex, among the household servants
named in his will, 1361, as “ potager, ferour, barber, ewer,” &c., mentions “ Will. de
Barton, hastiler.'' Roy. Wills, p. 52. 111 the Liber cure cocorum, the author thus states
the intention of his treatise.

“ Fyrst to 3ou I wylle schawe
120 poyntes 01 cure al by rawe ;
Of potage, hastery, and bakun mete,
And petecure Ι nylle for3ete.'' Sloane MS. 1986, f. 47.

The chapter “cle cibis assatis, 01 rostyd mete‚'' comprises a singular dish. termed
“hasteletes on fysshe day‚” consisting of figs, raisins, dates, and almonds, transfixed
on a ‘⁶ broche of irne,'' and roasted; f. 87, b. Compare Forme 01 Cury, p. 8. Among
the domestic officers of the Earl 01 Northumberland‚ 1511, was a “yoman cooke for
the mouth, who doith hourely attend in the kitching at the haistry for roisting of meat.''
Ant. Rep. iv, 244. Bp. Percy states that in Shropshire the fireplace is called haister3
and, according to Mr. Hartshorne, an hastener, or hasteler, is a kind of screen lined
with tin, used for reflecting the heat in roasting. See Salopia Ant. The derivation is
evidently from kasta. ‘⁴ Haste, a spit or broach. ’ COTG. Compare ROOSTARE, or haste-
lere, hereafter.
