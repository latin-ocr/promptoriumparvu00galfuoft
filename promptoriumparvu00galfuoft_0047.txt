PREFACE. xxxvi

ment in excellent preservation. The writing‚ of which a fac-simile is given,
is probably not much later than the date of the compilation; it is in two
columns, and carefully executed‚ distinct, and remarkably uniform through-
out. The leaves measure 93 inches in height by δὲ in breadth. The
first twelve are rubricated, the initial letter of each line being in red.
The English words also are underlined with the same color. A few
errors and omissions have been amended. Each quire of parchment has a
eheckword at the lower corner of its last leaf, and the leaves are num--
bered, the signatures running from A i to r, Arabio numerals being used
here and also throughout the MS. A small portion is deficient, by some
accidental oversight‚ namely in the verbs between Clyvyfi and Cracchyfi.
This MS. was formerly in the possession of Sir Symonds D’Ewes, Bart.
It is doubtless the same which is noticed by Bishop Tanner (Bibl. Brit. p.
305, published in 1748). On the reverse of the fly—leaf at the beginning
of the MS. the following note is written, “ This book belongs to Sir
Symonds Dews Library‚ and is to be restored.” [have been unable to
ascertain whether this possessor of the volume was the distinguished
statesman and antiquary of that name, compiler of the Journals of the
Parliament in the reign of Elizabet-h: he died in 1650. In the list of
MSS. in the possession of his grandson, Sir Symonds D'Ewes‚Bart. of
Stow Langtoft Hall, Suffolk‚ who succeeded in 1685, I find “ An ancient
Latin-English Dictionary written about the year 1440‚’' the volume pro-
bably now under consideration, but inadvert-ently described as Latin-
English instead of English-Latin.a There can‚however‚ be little doubt
that the valuable library at Stow Langtoft‚ of which this MS. formed part,
had been collected by the eminent scholar, the friend of Seldem Spelman,
and Cotton.

On the fly—leaf at the beginning of the Harl. MS. is pasted a slip of
paper, with the name probably of a former owner‚-—“ liber hugonis
barker.'’b

Ι may here repeat the observation previously made 0 that this valuable
MS„ although as I believe from internal evidence only a transcript, has

¹³ On the leaf at the end are some ‘medical receipts:·-“ M. Breuse haec me docuit.
