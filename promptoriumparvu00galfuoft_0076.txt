that of so many grammatica] works from his press.

Having described the various editions of the Ortus Vocabulorum, a com—
pilation which may be placed amongst the most rare „and instructive books
of its class and period in any count-ry, it may suffice to notice briefiy the
grammatical and lexicographical treatises from which materials for the
work were obtained. Ι have already pointed out that considerable assis-
tance may have been derived from the dictionary, precisely analogous in
character, attributed by Bale and other writers to the author of the Promp-
torium, namely the “ Medulla Grammatice,” to which the compiler in the
Prologue of the Ortus acknowledgcs his obligations. We here find like-
wise enumerated the “ Catholicon,'' of which some notice has been pre-
viously given (see p. xxiii. (mate) ς 3 compendium also of that voluminous
work entitled ‘⁶ Breviloquus ” 01· “ Vocabularius Breviloquus,⁷' attributed to
Guarinus, probably the learned grammarian of Verona, at the close of the
fourteenth century,a the “ Cornucopia'’ by Nicolas Perotti3 ¹³ and the “ Gem-
ma Vocab11101·un1‚” a dictionary which appears, by the number of editions
printed at Antwerp, the Hague, Strasburgh, and elsewhere, to have been
highly esteemed.c On comparison of a copy of a Latin-German dictionary
in my own possession, printed at Strasburgh, 1508, and entitled “ Voca-
bularius Gemma geminarnm,'' I find its contents for the most part iden-
tical with those of the Ortus, with the exception that English words are

1502, or, according to Maittaire„ Ann. Typ„ t. i. p. 728, in 1500. There may, how-
ever, have been more than one such work, somena-hat similar in title and not readily
to be distinguished. Among MSS. bequeathed by Junius to the Bodleian occurs—

place in 1518, Η Dictionarium quod Gemma Gemmarum vocant,'’ ὸῑο. but called “ Voca-
bularius Gemma gemmarum '’ in the colophon. Panzer and Brunet cite several editions

also of the “ Vocabulorum Geniniula,” the two earliest being those printed at Antwerp in
1472 and 1487.
