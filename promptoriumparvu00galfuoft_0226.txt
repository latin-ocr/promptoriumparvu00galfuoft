indicate that it was originally written dywere, or divere, which may be derived from tho
old Freneh, “ divers, inconstans, bisarre, 2'7zcommocle.’' ROQUEF. It occurs, however,
written as above, in a poem by Humphrey Brereton, who lived in the reign of Hen. VH.
which has been printed under the title of “the most pleasant song of Lady Bessy,
eldest daughter of King Edw. 1V.¹’

‘⁶ That time you promised my father dear,
To him to be both true and just,
And now you stand in a disweare,
Oh Jesu Christ, who may men trust 1 ”

following explanation of Pomp-sis, “proprie est discus sive ‘cas qnadranyulum, eo:
omni parte habens lateras aqualia, a dobuler.'’ The term is derived from the Freneh
doublzkr, a dish 3 it occurs in Piers Ploughman, and 15 51111 retained in the Cumberland
and Northern dialects. See Ray and Brockett.

² It appears that the compilet* of the Promptorium assigned to baltheus, which pro-
perly signifies the cinaedum 7122'litcc7·e‚ the unusual meaning of a garment of defence.
Thus 0οΤΕ ARMURE previously is rendered baltheus. The Catholicon explains “di-
plois. duplex vestis, ec cst vestis oizillcaris,’‘ but it does not appear to have been ori-
ginally, as it subsequently became on the disuse of the gambeson, a garment of defence.
The duhlectus mentioned in 1110 Constitutions of Fred. ΙΙ. King of Sicily, in the XIVth
century, was a garment of ordinary use by nobles and knights, as were also, it is pro-
bable‚ the rich garments provided for John ΙΙ. of France, in 1352, when Stephen de
Fontaine, his goldsmith‚ accounts for the delivery of ‘⁴ masin drap (Γον de damas, et un
ι1171 cumocas d’outremer‚pou7· faire clem: doublesss' At this period wadded defences
were made in Paris by the ‹w-murc'ers, and the tailors were divided into two crat'ts,
pourpoinliers and doubleliers ,· 11 was only in 1358 that the Regent Charles, on account
of the use of the doublet becoming general, permitted the tailors to exercise also the
craft of doubletz'ers. See the Reglemens sur les Metiers‚ edited by Depping, p. 414.
Shortly after, however, the doublet appears as a military defence3 ‘⁴ 25 doublettes, 24
jakkes‚'' and other armours, are enumerated among the munitions of Hadlegh Castle
granted in 1405 by Heni-y IV. to his son Humfrey. Rymer, viii. 384. The importance
at this time attached to the manufacture of this kind of armour appears by the privileges
conceeded in 1407 to the “ass-murariz's linearum armaturarum civitatis Lomlon·2'e.’'
Pat. 9 Hen. IV. confirmed 18 Hen. VI. and 5 Edw. IV. It is related that the Duke
