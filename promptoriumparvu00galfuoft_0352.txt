² Ground-ivy, giil, or ale-hoof‚ Gleckoma lwclemzcecz, Linn. was anciently esteemed
both in medicine and as a condiment used in the eoncoction of ale. G. de Bibelesworth
mentions “ega-e (130 boys, 0 effre terem-e (heyhowe.)'' Arund. MS. 220, f. 131. ‘⁸ Edem
terrestris ys an herbe pat me elepyb erth yme, or heyoue;” its virtues are detailed.
Roy. MS. 18 A. VI. f. 74, b. In John Arderne's Praetica, Sloane MS. 56, f. 61, the use
of ‘⁸ hailwue, ‘cel halehoue, ‘cel folfoyt, 'cel 1101·shoue,”in the composition of an unguent,
called Salus populi, is set forth. Gerard calls it ale-hoof, or tun-hoof‚ and states that
“ the women of our Northern parts, especially about &Vales and chesnii—e, do tunne the
herbe ale-hocf into their ale.'' Compare TUNEOVE, hereafter. Langham, in the Gar-
den of Health7 1579, details 1110 qualities of ‘⁶ Alehoofe, ground iuie, gilrumliith, ground
or Tudnoore;” and Cotgrave gives “palte de oleat, eats-foot, alehoofe‚ tunehoofe,
ground ivy, Gill ereep by the ground.'’ Skinner thought that ale-hoof was derived
from all, and behofe, utititas, from its numerous medieinal properties, but the derivation
of the name is possibly from hof, unyula, in allusion to the hoof-shaped leaf. In the
west, the plant colt’s-foot is called herse's-hoof. It is possible that the readhofe of
of the AngloffSaxon herbals is the ground ivy, to which, however, the name eorffiifig was
assigned.

³ The reading here seems to require correction ; the word does not occur in the other
MSS. or in the printed editions. Amarea is explained by Ugutio, and in the Ortus, to
be ‘⁶ ἰωὴ-ἰοῦ· fex olei, dregs of oyle,'’ but illuvio, signifies the ‘⁴ superior fea: olei ,· '¹ and
1105'13 here seems to be put for sueh impurities as fleat on the surface. Compare the verb
