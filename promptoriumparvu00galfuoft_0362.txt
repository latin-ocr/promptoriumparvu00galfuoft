¹ The application of enamel to every description of ornamental work in metal was
much used in England from the Anglo-Saxon times, until the XVIth cent. The num-
ber of existing specimens is, indeed, small; owing, probably, to the precious metals
having been most frequently employed for enamelled works, which have been melted
down to form ornaments suited to the successive changes of fashion; but ancient wills
and inventories‚ especially the lists of crown jewels printed in the Kalend-ars of the
Exchequer Treasury, afford abundant evidence of the profusion of enamelled plate and
jewellery in England. There may be but insufficient evidence to show that the earliest
works of this kind, such as fibulae, and minor personal ornaments, were executed by
British artificers3 but the character of ornament which is presented by them, the men·
tion that is made in early records of the skill of our countrymen, and the distinctive
term of Opus Aufilenum, to designate their ornamental works in metal, give to such
a supposition a high degree of probability. A specimen of interest preserved in the
British Museum appears by the legend to have been the ring of Ethelwulf, King of
WVessex, from 836 to 858, father of Alfred. See Archaeol. vii. pl. xxx. It is of gold,
and appears to be properly an enamelled work, the field, according to the ordinary pro-
cess of the earlier period, being chiselled out to receive a vitrified metallic compound
of a dark blue colour, which was fixed by fusion in the cavities formed by the tool, and
set off the design produced by those parts of the metal that had been left in relief.
Another mode of workmanship, in some degree analogous, appears in the jewel at the
Ashmolean Museum, attributed to AJfred; a specimen recently discovered in London,
Archaeol. xxix. pl. x. and a few other instances. In these a semi-transparent substance,
which appears to be rather a vitreous paste than a true enamel, fills the spaces in the
field of the design, the outline being formed, not by chiselling the solid metaL but by
means of thin fillets of gold, attached to the surface of the plate, and serving to detach
the variously coloured portions of the design. Ata later period the pre-eminent skill
of the enamellers of Limoges caused their work to be highly esteemed in other countries.
It appears that the tomb of Walter de Menon, Bp. Rochester‚ 1274, was made by
Magister Johannes de Limogia, who came to England for the purpose. See the Exe-
cutors’ Accounts‚ Thorpe’s Cust. Roff. 193. At the Reformation this memorial was
destroyed; but the enamelled effigy in lVestminster Abbey, representing Will. de Valence,
who died 1296, if not the work ot* John of Limoges, affords an interesting specimen
of the art practlsed at that place. The prevailing use of ornaments of this nature appears
also from the Constit. of Will. de moys, 1229, and Walt. de Cantilupe, 1:240, Bishops

enamelled ornaments of this period, as connected with England‚ are the small shrines
called cqfri Lonoricenses, on which is represented the martyrdom of St. Thomas of Can-
tor-bury. One of these is 111 the possession of thc Ant. Soc. and another at Hereford
