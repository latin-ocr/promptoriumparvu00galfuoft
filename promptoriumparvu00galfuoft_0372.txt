Lair in an ornamental network. which occasionally was jewelled‚ seems ‘to have obtained
in England from the time of Heu. III. until that of Elizabeth‚ and an endless variety of
examples are afforded by illuminated MSS. and monumental effigies. It was termed calle

and it had also the appellation ‘⁵ creepen‚'' crespine, still retained in southern Europe to
denote the pieturesque head-dresses of the females, formed with net-work of coloured
silk, and which still present many of the fashions of ancient times. The head-attire of
the lovely lady who led in Sir Galmn to the court of King Arthur is thus described
(Anturs of Arther, ed. Robson, p. 14) :

“ Her fax in fyne perre was frettut and sold,
Her counter-felit and hur kelle were colurt ful clene.'‘ St. 29.

hrane which sometimes covers the head of a new-born infant, termed the caul, and in the
North the silly-hom noticed by Grose and Brund, has been mentioned in the note on the

'2 The signification of ΚΕΜΡΕ, as applied to fish, is very obscure. Kemp, from Aug.-
Sax. cempa, miles, signifies a knight or chanipion, and thence implies excellence or supe-
riority, as in strength, or unusual size. See the remarks of lhre on Su. G. kaempe,
athleta. “A kempe, 1ιῖιὶ a giaiide.” CATH. ΑΚΘ, Kempe may therefore here denote an
ecl of the largest size, called otherwise a fausen eel, or a spitchcock. In the version of
