he became Provincial of the Dominican Order in England3 was nominated
Archbishop of Canterbury by Gregory X. in 12723 resigned the see on
being made a cardinal by Nicholas ΙΙΙ. in 12783 and died shortly after at
Viterbo, as it was alleged, by poison. Among his numerous works enu—
merated by Pits and Tanner there are several grammatical and other
treatises which may have supplied materials to the compiler of the Promp-
torium‚ such as the “ Tractatus de ortu scientiarum‚⁷’ of which copies
exist in Cott. MS. Vitell. A. 1., f. 173 ; in the Bodleian library among the
Digby MSS.; in the college libraries of Merton and Balliol, and elsewhere.
He wrote commentaries on Priscian's treatise De Constructione‚ on Donatus,
and on various works of Aristotle.

11. Alexander Neccham.--A full account of the voluminous writings of
Neckam or Neccham, one of the most erudite scholars of his time, is given
by Leland, Pits, Tanner, and other writers on the literary history of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. He was a native of Herffordshioe, born
at or near St. Alban's about A.D. 1157, and pursued his studies in the
schools of France and Italy, where his learning was held in high estimation.
In 1215 he became Abbot of Cirencester3 he died at VVorcester in 1217.
His principal works were theological. He compiled also atreatise ‘⁶ De rerum
naturis‚'’ a “ Repertorium Vocabulorum,'’ an “ Elucidarium Bibliothecae‚’'
explanatory of difficult words in the Scriptures; also a treatise entitled
“ Isagoge ad Artes.” The first of these, namely “De naturis rerum libri duo
priores,'' has recently been edited by Mr. Wright for the series of Chronicles
and Memorials of Great Britain published under the direction of the Master
of the Rolls. It was, however, as I believe, from the treatise “De nominibus
Utensilium” of Alexander Neccham that the compiler of the Prompto-
rium derived a large number of Latin words. That curious little work

has been given by Mr. Wright, in the collection of Vocabularies to which
I have already made frequent reference, from Cotton. MS. Titus D. XX„

a copy written about the close of the thirteenth century, and accompanied
by interlinear English glosses.²¹ The text has been collated with two other
MSS. in the Imperial Library at Paris.¹' There was a copy in the cathedral
