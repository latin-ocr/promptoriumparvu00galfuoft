Thus in the version of Vegecius, Roy. MS. 18 A. XII. it is related that Scipio bid his
Spanish prisoners cleanse and dig ditches, ‘⁴ with this reprouable scorne; ye ben worthy,
he saide, to be blottede and spottede, foulede and defoulede with fenne and with drit
of water (lato inquinari) and of blode, bat in tyme of werre ne were not, ne wolde nat
be bespreynt ne be wette with ennemyes blode.” B. iii. c. 10.

¹ Before the general introduction of glazed windows, their place was supplied by
fra-med blinds 01¹ eloth οι· eanvas, termed fenestrulis, which are mentioned in the
accounts of the executore of Queen Eleanor, A.D. 1291, as follows: “pro maamad
fenestrellas, ad scaccarium It'effl‘uoe (apud ll'estmouasterium, izjds’ Household Expenses,
presented to the Roxburghe Club by B. Botfield, Esq. p. 135. “Fenestralh chsassz's
de loz'lle, ου, (le pazepc'er (papien-‚Y' PALSG'. Hornian says that “glascn wyndowis let
in the lyght, and kepe out the winde ; paper or lyn clothe straked acrosse with losyngys
make fenestrals 111 stede of glasen wyndowes. I wyll have a latesse (dallei-unc) before
the glasse for brekynge. I have many prety wyndowes shette with leuys goynge up and
downe (calzestellae quw attolli ec demitti possunt).'' Not long subsequently to the time
when Horman wrote, glazed windows became so generally in use that the fenestrall
was laid aside. Harrison, who wrote his description of England about 1579, speaks
of “lattise made of wicker, or fine rifts of oke in chekerwise,'' formerly much used 111
country houses instead of glass, as being then obsolete. He speaks of the use of horn,
selenste, and 1161111, for glazing windows, observing that of the last ‘⁴ an example is yet
to be seene in Sudleie castell; '’ and states that glass had become so cheap andplen-
tiful, being imported from Burgundy, Normandy, and Fhmders, as well as made in
England, of good quality, that every one who chose might have abundanee. B. ii. c. 12.
Holinsh. Chron. i. 187. Leland noticed “ the Hawle of Sudley Oastle glased with rownd
Beralls.'' Itin. iv. f. 170, a; viii. f. 74, b.

2 “ Fenelle, or fenkelle‚ feniculum, maroti-um.” CATH. ANG. The numerous virtues
of this herb are thus summed up in the King's Coll. MS. of the Promptorium :

“ Bis duo «lut omn-atrum ,febres fugat alque venenum,
Etpzwfflzt stonmcam, sic reddit lamen acucum.''

Macer gives a detailed account, in which the following remarkable passages occur:
“be edderes wole ete fenel, when her yen dasnyb, and so she getii) a-yene her clere
sighte; and ber boroghe it is founde and preved bat fenel (101) profit to mannis yene:
be yen bat ben dusked, and dasnib, shul be anoyntesl wit 1)6 ius of fenelle rotis medeled
wit hony; and bis oynement shalle put a-way alle be dasewenesse of hem, and make
hem bry3t.'' The virtue of fennel, in restoring youth, was a discovery attributed
likewise by Macer to serpents 3 ‘¹ bis prouib auctours and filisoferis, sor serpentis whan
men (sic) ome, and willeth to wexe strong-e³ myghty, and 5011eg a-yean‚ bei gon and
eten oste fenel, and l>ei become yongliche and myghty.‘' MS. in the possession of H. W.
Diamond, Esq. FENKYLLE is obviously a corruption of the Latin uame; this herb is
still called 111 German Fenchel, and 111 Dutch Venckel. In Picrs Plougl11nan·s Vision
mention occurs of

“ A fcrthing worth of fynkcl-sczlc for fastyugc dai‹,=s.’‘
