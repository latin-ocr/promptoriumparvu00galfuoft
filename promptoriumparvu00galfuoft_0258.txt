¹ In the Assembly of Ladies, a poem attributed to Chaucer, Attemperaunce is described
as arrayed in a blue gown of eloth of gold, in tabard-wise, purfled, or trimmed with
sur, and set with pearls and diamonds.

“After a sort, the coller and the vent,
Like as armine is made in purfeling,
With great pearles full fine and orient,
They were couched all after one worching.’'

The glossarist interprets vent as signifying “the fore-part3 ’' but this does not suffi-
ciently explain the term. In the XIIIth cent. the fent or vent appears at the collar of
the robe, both in male and female costume, being a short slit closed by a brooch, and
which served for greater. convenience in putting on a dress so fashioned as to fit closely
round the tliroat. This is shown by the effigies at Fontevrault, engraved by Stothard,
and especially by those of Queen Berengaria„ at the abbey of l‘Espam and of Richard L,
recently discovered at Rouen. Archaeol. xxix. pl. xxi. In these instances it is suffi-
ciently apparent why the fent should be termed, as in the I'romptorium,fibulam-ium,⁴
but at a later period being considerably prolonged, the opening of the robe in front
extending often much below the vmist, a brooch was no longer sufficient to close it. At
the period when Chaucer wrote, the sent was trimmed with rich furs, and the fastenings
were ornaments of chased work, jevvelled‚ of a very splendid description. They are
termed in inventories ‘⁴ attacloesst' and exhibited on the effigies of Lady Mohun, and of
Joan of Navarre, Queen of Henry IV„ at Canterbury. The less richly decorated effigy
of Queen Philippa, at westminster, presents an example of the fent, simply clossd by a
lace; and the combination of furs and jewels in this part of costume appears in many
MSS. which have furnished Strutt with examples, among which may particularly be
mentioned Roy. MS. 16 G. V. See Strutt's Dresses, pl. xciv. The propriety of applying
to the sent. thus purfled and adorned, the term fimbria, as in the Promptorium, is
evident, as likevvise limbus, which is given by Ducange, on an ancient authority, as
synonymous xvitlrtihululorz'um. In the Wardrobe of Sir John Fastolf. A.D. 1459, there
was “j jakket ot* red felwet, the ventis bounde with red lether.'' Archaeol. xxi. 253,
“ Fente of a govvne‚fente.'' PALSG.
