wocer,fraclas. usura. In the earlier Wicliffite version it is said of the “ comelyng‚'’
Dent. xxviii. -Η, “ He shal oker to thee (al. gauyl) and thou shalt not oker to hym,’'
in the later version ‘⁴ leene‚’' (scenerabit‚ Vulg.) Hardyng says of the times of Edw. I.
that great complaints were made of the ‘¹ okoure and vsury ” practised by the Jews
abiding in the land. Chron, c. 150. The curious compilation, entitled Flos floram,
Burney MS, 356, comprises the points and articles of ⁸⁸ Corsynge or mansynge‚” to be
shewn by each parson to his fiock four times in the year, in the mother tongue; in which
are named ‘⁴ alle vsureres, alle bat makeb ober writeb bat oker shal be payd 3 obet· yf
hyt be payd, bat hyt ne be restored.'’ p. 98. So likewise it is said in the ancient
treatise cited in Becon’s Reliques of Rome, 1563, p. 259, that “all okereris and
usureris (ben accursed), that is to say, if a man or woman lend good to her neyhbour
for to take aduauntage for her lending.” In the verses on the seventh commandment
in the “ Speculum Xpistiani ’' (by John VVatton ?) it is said,
“ Be thou no theef, no theuys fere,

Ne nothyng wynne thurgh trechery:

Okur nor symonye come thou not nere,

But conscience clere kepe ay truly.''

de VVorde, 1506, sign. c. iij. where the companions of avarice are said to be usury,
rapine, false swearing, and ‘⁵ okerye.'’

⁴2 In the earlier Wieliffite version, Lev. xiii. 47 is thus rendered : ‘¹ A wullun clooth‚
or lynnen that hath a lepre in the oof (in stamine, Vulg.) or in the werpe—it shal be
holdun a lepre.'' Stamen. is properly the warp, or ground-work of the web, as it is
rendered in the Ortus ; trama is the woof‚ or transverse texture. Ang.-Sax. west, sub-
teqmen. The reading of the MS. is Traura. but as no such word is found in the
Catholioen, the reading of the Wineh. MS. and Pynson’s edit. has been adopted.
“ Trama,fllam inter stamen discurrens.'’ cATH.

3 “Nefrendzcium a cherles rent, and a present of a disciple.” MED. HARL. MS.
9270. Compare οΜΑρΕ, which is rendered likewise hythe word nefrendicium. In the
catholicon nefrendiciam is said to be derived from ncfrendis. a barrow pig, and to
signify ‘⁴ annuale tributum quod rustici suis dominis circa nativitatem, vel alio tempore
anni, solent afferre,- et quod parri discipali suis doctoribus apportant, duntaxat sit
carneum, scilicet porcellus vel lz⁷1jusm01li.’' In Brand’s Popular Antiquities much
