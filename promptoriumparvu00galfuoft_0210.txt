¹ Culpon, derived from the Latin colpo, or the French conpon, a shred, or any por-
tion cut off, is a term not uncommon in the early romances.

‘⁴ Al to peoes thai hewed thair sheldes,
The eulpons flegh out in the feldeS.” Ywaine and Gawin, 641.

Hoveden, speaking of the livery allowed to the King of Scotland at the court of King
Riehard in 1194, says 119 had “ 40 grossos Zongyos cospones de dominica camlelti ReqisJ'
Chaueer says of the long hair of the Pardoner, which hung ‘⁶' by vnces '' on 1115 shoulders,

“Culpon that troute’' is given as the proper term of the art, in the “Boke of
Kerving,'’ 1508. ‘⁶ Culpit‚ a large lump of anything.’' FORBY.

and Gawin, 1627. “ Komelynge '³ occurs in Rob. of Gloucester3 “ comlyng.'' R. Brunne.

⁴ Cumnawnte or eomenaunt are perhaps corruptions of the Freneh convenam. In
Sir John Howard's Household Book, entries frequently occur of agreements made with
‹lomestics or artificers, always expres-ed by the term comenaunt. In 1464 his steward
made the following note: ‘¹ My master made comenaunt at Fressefeld with .....
Carpenter, χῖ 119 59113119 be wyth hym this xii monyth, and 119 shalle have in mony xxxs.
