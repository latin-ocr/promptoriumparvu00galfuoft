Fremh, ‘⁴ ganeo& ivroffize, (lebanehe ROQUEF. The Proclamation of the Mayor of Nor-
wieh, on coming into office, set forth “ that all Brewsters and Gannokers selle a gallon
ale, of the best, be measure a-selyd, for ld. οἳ). and a galon of the next for 1cl.'' A.D.

¹ The bird now called gannet, or Solan 30050, sula, alba, abounds only on the Bass
Island, in the Firth of Forth. In the Exch. Roll of Normandy‚ A.D. 1180, p. 57, an
entry occurs “pro pastu yawztamznz qne venerunt (Ze Aagslid, (sepa-o lx. (le illis ducendis
acl Aryetztomum, et lx. ad Buram, vi li. ἐφ’ so. et ix cl.'’ Giraldus mentions the GANTE
among the birds of Ireland; ‘⁶ Auca] minores alboe (qua) et yantas (licuntur) et yreycztz'm in

² The reading of the lVinchester MS. is probably here correct. In Norfolk a gage 15,
according to Forby, a bowl or tub to receive the cream‚ as it is successively skimmed off ;
so called, as he observes, from its use as a gange, to show when a sufficient quantity has
been collected to be churned. The word does not occur 111 the other MSS.

³ In a treatise of the seasons, printed with Arnold’s Chron. p. 17⁶2, it is recommended
that in winter “ men shulde lete them bloode in ther bodys by garsinge, but not on veynes,
but if it be the more nede ;” meaning the operation of cupping, called in the Promp-
torium Bors‘rox'. “To gaiso, sc1s,2·zjri1.·m·e.” CATH. ANG. “ Omma, a cut, a garse, an
incision.'' Em‘o'r.

⁴ The term ANGYLLE‚ to take wythe fysche‚ meaning a fishing rod, has occurred already,
as also ELYER, or elgerV which appears to be an eel-spear. ·‘ Comus, an algere, a shaft. a
dartt, a polloure. Furrina. a hoke for fysshe, an algere.'‘ MED. MS. CANT. The
word GARFANGYL seems wholly obsolete; possibly the first syllable may be traced to
Ang.-Sax. gar, jaculum, er the implement may be a kind of spear used 111 taking the
GARFYSCHE.

⁵ Sir T. Bromi, in his account of the fishes of the Norfolk coast, mentions the gar-
fish, or greenback (Esoas belone, Linn.) Harrison mentions it among fish usually taken3
