1 Merry is not infrequently used by the old writers in the sense of pleasant. Aug.-
Sax. myrig‚jzccu⁷zdus. In the version of Vegecius, attributed to Trevisa, Roy. MS. 18
A. XII. it is observed that wise warriors in olden times used to ⁴⁴ occupie theire foot
menne in dedes of armes in the felde in mery wedire, and vndre roof in housing in
fowle wedre.” B. 111. c. ΞΖ. Again, precaution is recommended at sea against unsettled
weather, and the diversity of places, ‘⁴ the whiche maketh ofte of mery wedre grete
tempestes, and of grete tempestes mery weder and clere-⁷³ B. ιν. c. 38. The arms
borne by the name of Merewether are to be classed with the armoirz'es parlantes,-
namely‚ Or, three martlets sable, on a chief azure a sun in splendour3 the martlet
being, as it was supposed, an omen of fair weather.

2 This word occurs in Brunne's version of Langtoft‚ p. 176 ; Chaucer’s Rom. of R.
v. 5339 ; the Vis. of Piers Ploughman ; Awntyrs of Arthure, 68; Towneley Myst. p. 167.
In a description of hell, in Add. MS. 10,053, p. 136, the following passage occurs z

⁴⁴ Synne shal to endeles payne the lede
In helle, that is hidous and merke.—
Ther is stynk, and smoke a-mong‚
And merkenesse, more than euer was here.'‘

³ This term apparently denotes crumbs or grated particles of bread‚ called in French
mies, or mioclzes. ‘⁴ blica, reliquie panis, vel quod cadit de pane dum fravzyitur et
comeditur, ἅμ’. a crome of brede.’' ossTns. In the Book of Cookery, written 1381,
and printed by Pegge with the Forme of Cury, it is directed to take onions, ‘⁴ and
myee hem ri3t smal‚'' as also to ⁴⁴ myse bred‚’' διο. pp. 93, 95. The participle ⁴⁴ myyd ’³
occurs in Sloane MS. 1936, f. 85, and other passages, and signifies grated bread,
which, as it has been observed in the note on the verb GRATE, p. 207, was much used
in ancient cookery.
