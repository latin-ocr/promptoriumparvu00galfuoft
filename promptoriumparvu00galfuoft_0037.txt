PREFACE. xxix

in double columns, in a small neat hand of the thirteenth century, with
marginal explanations and interlinear glosses by a second scribe in paler
ink. It commences,—-“ Commentarius liber iste curialium personarum et
rerum et vocabulorum preorditur,'’ and ends as follows,-“ Hec edita sunt
parysius sub venerabili cancellario parysius Galtero de castello Theoderici,
anno domini 21⁰.cc⁰.40⁰. sexto gloriosum et admirabilem partum beate Marie
Virginis demonstrante.'‘ If, as appears most probable‚ this tract, written
in the style and manner of the Dictionarius by John de Gariandia previously
noticed, can be recognised with certainty as from his pen, this colophon
and date at its close supply fresh and conclusive evidence in regard to the
disputed question of the period when he wrote, and agree perfectly with
the circumstances mentioned hereafter in regard to his work “ de Myste-
riis ecclesie,'' and its dedication to Fulke, Bishop of London, in the first
half of the thirteenth century. The Commentarius curialium seems well
deserving of being printed, as illustrative not only of language but of
manners and customs, and of social life at that period. The text is
moreover fullos French words explanatory of Latin terms of which a
considerable portion are found scattered through the pages of the Promp—
torium.

7. Libellus misteriorum qui dicitur Anglia que fulget (quo fulget,
Prompt. Winch. MS.)—Among works attributed to John de Garlandia
a treatise is mentioned by Bale, p. 153, on the authority of Bostonus
Buriensis, entitled ‘⁴ Mysteriorum Ecclesiae, lib. 1. Anqlz‘a quo tendis tua
dum.'’ Pits‚ p. 184, gives the same line as the commencement of a
work with the title thus slightly varied, “De mysteriis Ecclesiae:'' he
mentions also a commentary upon it. Leyser includes it in his list of the
writings of Garlande.³ A copy of a metrical treatise with a similar title
but commencing “Anglia quoficlqet,'’ may be found in Cott. MS. Claudius
A. vm. f. 204 b., concluding thus, “Lucida terribulum redolem campana
sonora;'’ and there is also a copy in a collection of grammatical tracts
chiefly by John de Garlandia in Caius College Library, Cambridge.b The
prefatory lines commence thus :—
