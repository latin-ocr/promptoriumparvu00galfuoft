Ang.-Sax. laece, medicus. The appellation was used to denote those who professed any
branch of the healing art, as well as the ladies, who frequently supplied the place of the
regular practitioners. Amongst the innumerable treatises of the ancient hei-baliste few
afford a more curious insight into the practices of leech-craft, about the period when the
Promptorium was compiled, than Arund. MS. 42. The author, who had a herb-garden
at Stepney‚ states that he “ knew a lady, be lady Sowche, lae beste &odys leche of 13153111-
1011(1, 111 women,'' and recounts her practice in preparing a nostrum, termed ‘⁴ nerual.”
f. 22. The fourth, or ring finger, was called the leech finger, from the pulsation
therein found, and supposed to be in more direct communieation with the heart, as in
the tract attributed to ι1011. de Gariandia, under the title of Distigius, Harl. MS. 1002,
f. 115, it is said, “Stat medius (medyile fyngure) medio, medicus (leche fyngure) jam
convenit (accordyt) cyro? In another line the fingere are thus enumerated: “ Pollex,
index, medius, medicus, auricvlaris.'' CATH. ANG. See Brand's Popular Antiquities.

¹ The term leche, which occurs frequently in connection with ancient cookery‚ had two
distinct significations. It denoted such viands as it was usual to serve in sliees, probably
for the sake of convenience, before the general use of forks. “Lesclae, a long sliee, or
shive of bread, &c.” COTG. The nature and variety of dishes thus to be served may be
learned from Harl. MS. 279, where recipes are given for 64 different ⁴‘ Leche vyaundys;''
and where the meaning of the verb to leche is evident from such directions as the follow-
ing: ‘⁴ Brawn in comfffte—leehe it fayre wyth a knyff, but not to hinne, and ban 3if bon
wolt bon my3t take be rybbys of be bore al bare, and chete hem enlongys borw be lechys,
an so serue forth a leche or to in euery dysshe.'’ f. 27, b. Compare the use of the verb
to “ leshe‚’' Forme of Cury, pp. 36, 56, 573 “yleeshed,” p. 18. Compare the “ leyched
beefe '¹ as ordered for supper in the dietary of the Princess Cecill, with the item “ beefe
sliced‚” in the Ordinances of Eltham, Househ. Ord. pp. ⁹238, 181. R. Holme gives this
signification, iii. p. 78, and another sense, namely, “a kind of jeHy, made of cream,
isinglass, sugas, and almonds.” p. 83, “white leach, yclatimz andydalorumss' BARn'r.
“ Leche made of flesshe, ye'le‘eJ’ PALSG. One lechemeat appears to have formed an ordi-
nary portion of ever),v couree‚as may be gathered from the bills of fare at various great
festivities, Harl. MS. 1279, f. 44, and from the accounts of the installation feasts of Abp.
Nes-ill, 1466, Lel. Coll. vi. 6; of Abp. Morton, 1478, Arnold's Chron. 2393 and the
coronation banquet of Elizabeth, Quocn of Hen. VII. 1457, Lel. Coll. iv. 226. The various
kinds of “ leche '' named in these documenta appear to have ranged with ‘¹ suttleties‚''
such as “leche Luinhart gylt, partie gelly, leche porpul‚ damaske, reiall‚ ciprus‚ rube,
Florentine,” Ac. See further the Roll of Cookery appended to the Household Ordi-
nances; the Liber cure cocorum, Sloane MS. 19863 and Cott. MS. Jul. D. VIII. Skinner
interprets brawn lechyd, which is mentioned in the St. Alban's Book, as signifying ‘⁶ (ψω-
ηᾱαίἰξυ(ιίαε, aromatis cosalitvss' as if the term had some connection with Ang.-Sax. hece,
3116( Icus.
