1 This term evidently implies the implement used for mashing or mixing the malt, to
which, from resemblance in form, the name rudder is also given. In Withal’s little
Dictionary, enlarged by W. Clerk, among the instruments of the Brew-house, is given
‘¹ a rudder, or instrument to stir the meash-fatte with, motaculum.''

2 “ A maser, cantaras. murra, murreus.- hec murpis arbor est. ’³ CATH. ANG.
‘⁶ Masar of woode, masiere, mrumst PALSG. There can be little doubt that the
maser, the favourite drinking vessel used by every class of society in former times,
was called marrus, from a supposed resemblance to the famed Myrrhene vases of
antiquity. The inaser was, however, formed of wood, especially the knotty-grained
maple, and esteemed in proportion to the quality of the veined and mottled material,
but especially the valne of the bands and rings of precious metals, enamelled, chased,
or graven, with which the wood was mounted. In Latin this kind of vessel was called
memorium, moder-inus, madelinus, masdrinum, &c. in French madre, maselin, or ma-
zerin ; and it seems probable that the name mether, applied to the ancient cups of wood
preserved in Ireland, may be of cognate derivation. Amongst innumerable instances
where mention occurs of the cyphus marrow, or maser, in wills and other documents,
may be cited the Inventories taken at St. Paul‘s, 1295, printed by Dugdale, and at
Canterbury, 1:328, given by Dart from Cott. MS. Galba, E. lv. f. 135. In the Register
of benefactors of St. Albans‚ Nero, D. vrri. f. 87, Thos. de Hatfelde, Bp. of Durham,
1345, is represented holding his gift in his hands, namely, a covered mazer, “cyphum
suum murreum, quem &Vesheyl nostris temporibus appellamus.” A maser very similar
in form, but without a cover, was in the possession of the late John Gage Rokewode‚
Esq. It is of knotty, dark-coloured wood, mounted with metal: on the small plate,
termed crusta, attached to the bottom, is graven the monogram IHC. and around the

brim the following conplet x
“ -ξ- Hold 3owre tunge, and sey be best,
and let 3owre ney3b0re sitte in rest :
Hoe so lustybe god to plese,
let hys ney3bore lyue in ese.”

Similar instances of masers bearing inscriptions may be found in Testam. Ebor. i. 5209,
and Richard's Hist. of Lynn, i. 479. Doublet‚ in his Hist. of St. Denis, describes
the richly·ornamented ‘⁶ hanap de bois de mardre,’' which had been used by St. honis,
and presented to that church. “ Vermiculatns, variatus ad modum vermis, distinctus,
rubens, maderde.'¹ MED. “ Madre', of wood whose grain is full of crooked and speckled
streakes, οι· veins.’' coro. Plautin, in the Flemish Dict. 1573, gives ‘⁴ Maser, ‘em
noeud ou besse ἷι un arbre nomme'e erable. Maseren hout, acernum liyuzcm.’' In Syre
Gawene and the Carle a lady's harp is described, formed “ of masere fyne‚” v. 433,
which Sir F. Madden explains to be the wood of the maple. See on the manufacture
