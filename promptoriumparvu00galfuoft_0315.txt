that the grype and the griffon are frequently confounded. “ Gripho‚ ‘nomen avis, a grype.
Griphes vel ssi-ipe, (senus animalis, a grype. Vultur est avis οηαμηα et rapax .· ut dicunt,
de aere et ozon cle concubitu concipit, a grype.” ORTUS. ‘⁴ Vaultour, a vulture, geire,
gripe, or grap ; a ravenous bird. ijffoa, a gripe or griffon.'' σοῖσι. Holinshed says in
the Hist. of the Conquest of Ireland, B. ii. c. 18, that the “griph or geire is a kind ot'
eagle, but such as is ravenous, and seedeth more vpon carren than upon anie foule of his
owne preieng; and for his cowardnesse carieth neither the name nor praise apperteining
to the true eagle.” The egg of the grype‚ frequently mentioned as a rarity much valued,
and used as a drinking-cup, is probably to be referred to the fabulous animal, the griffon,
and may have been merely the egg of the ostrich. Gower relates that Albinus kept the
skull of Germund, which was fashioned as a goblet,

List of crown jewels, &c. dem-med 1 Hen. IV. 1399. In the same inventory are named
six “ ‘'lzanaps, ' or drinking cups called‘ ‘gryppesliey.” Kalend. of Exeh. iii. 3] 9, 330.
In the will of William Gascoigne, Lord Chief Justiee, dated 1419, is mentioned ‘⁴ ciplms,
vocatus a gryp ey, [lyctius cum (noyento, et deaurato.” Testam. Ebor. i. 303. In the
Invent. of Fountains Abbey, taken at the dissolution‚ and given by Burton, occurs the
item, ‘⁴ A grype schill, with a covering gilt, 27 OZ.’⁷

¹ “Aralc'unculffi fossa parva que instar sulci m·atm·.'' CATH. The term grype occurs
in an award, dated 1424,re1ating to the bounds of lands of the Prior of Bodmin, as
follows: “The bounde that eomyth thurgh the donne—goyng· don to another stone
stondynge of olde tyme in the bank of. a grype‚--and so the diche (called Kenediche) and
the gripe‚ &c.’' Mon. Ang. new ed. from Harl. Cart. 57 A. 35. This word is still used
in Sussex, and many parts of England. In Norfolk‚ Forby states that a trench, not
amounting to a ditch, 15 called a grup3 if narrower still, a grip; and if extremely nai-row,

³ Marchanwte, MS. The original meaning of the term grocer is defined in the stat.
37 Edw. 111. 1363, respecting “ Illarclzawztz nomez grossers,'' so called because they
‘⁴ enyrossent (oles marm-s des marchamlises vendables,” and kept them back in order to
sell at an improved price. Stat. of Realm, i. 379. In the following century they were
established as a distinet trade; see the “ Incorporacio Groceriorum Lond.” Pat. 7 Hen.
VI. and another patent in the year following, “pro custocl’ misteroe G'rocerioe.'' Before
rthe early part of the XVIth cent. their dealings seem to have become limited to grocery,
as now understood: thus Palsgrave gives “ grocer, ymssier, espicier.'' Seplassarius is
explained as meaning ‘⁴ myociator, qui multa venzmdatff’ See Ducange.
