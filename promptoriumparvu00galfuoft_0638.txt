the language of prayer, is well known. Of its use as betokening contempt, or in addressing
inferiors, examples might be cited from an early period. Shakspeare describes the foolish
suitor in “Twelftli Night,'' desirous to provoke his rival the Duke of Illyria with a
challenge‚ and thus advised--“If thou llzou'st him some thriee it shall not be amiss.’'
Aet iii. 50. 2. At an earlier period the question of monastic propriety in regard to
addressing novices eontemptuously by thee and thou was thought deserving of discussion
at the General Chapter of Northampton (See 0. x. de Novitiis). Erasmus in his Adayia
1013105 1110 crasty subterfuge of a miserly patient, who repaid his German physieian with
idle promises; whereupon the latter meeting him one day reminded him of the obligation-

⁵ ‘¹ Yarowe, mylfoile, an herbe, Enrevel' PALSG. Forby mentions, under plants of
omen, a singular mode of divination practised in Nort'olk by means of the yarrow, Achilloea
vrzz'llefoliam, there called Yarroway. One of the serrated leaves is used to tiekle the inside
of the nostrils, whilst the following distich is repeated. If blood follows this 01131111, success
in courtship is held to be certain :

“ Yarroway, yarroway, bear a white blow;
If my love love me, my nose will bleed now.'q

See Forby's vocab. E. Angl., App. p. 424. The omen may possibly have been regarded
as of greater value hy the use of this particular plant because it was a homely remedy
against bleeding. Thus Langham, in his Garden of Health‚ says of ‘⁶ Milfoyle 01· Yarrowe
--—sta¹npe it and apply it to wounds to stop the blood, and to stop bleeding at the nose.''
